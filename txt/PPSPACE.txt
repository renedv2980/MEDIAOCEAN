<t>Print Space Descriptions                                                     
  A print space description is comprised of one or both of the                  
following-                                                                      
                                                                                
    1) a size expression                                                        
                                                                                
    2) an additional description following the size                             
                                                                                
  Other identifiers are needed to cost a print insertion, such as               
edition, section, position, colour, covers, etc., but these                     
additional attributes are not considered part of the space                      
description for our purposes here. See section on SPECIALS.                     
                                                                                
  The size expression typically consists of a numeric expression                
and a unit descriptor, eg. 1/2 PAGE. It may also be a two dimensional           
expression like 100IN x 4C.                                                     
                                                                                
  The size expression is not to be confused with the actual physical            
dimensions of the space, though the two may in fact coincide. The               
physical dimensions are part of the mechanical data and are always              
given in real measurements like inches or millimeters, not lines,               
columns or pages. They are part of the data that is retrieved from              
the publication record based on the space description.

<h0>syntax rules for size expressions                                           
1) There may be one or two dimensions given.                                    
                                                                                
     example-  120 lines                                                        
               4 i x 3 col                                                      
                                                                                
2) A dimension consists of a number expression followed by a                    
   unit descriptor (which maybe implied).                                       
                                                                                
3) Only certain combinations of units are allowed (see above).                  
                                                                                
4) If the unit descriptor is given for only one dimension, the                  
   other dimension is assumed to have the same descriptor.                      
                                                                                
    example-  280 x 320 mm                                                      
                                                                                
   Note that '100 x 50 lines' is invalid because lines cannot                   
   be used in combination with lines.                                           
                                                                                
5) If neither dimension has a unit descriptor, both descriptors                 
   should be taken from the previous size expression, if any, in                
   order to eliminate having to restate them when entering                      
   multiple space descriptions.                                                 
                                                                                
6) X is the only valid connector between the two dimensions                     
   of a size expression.                                                        
                                                                                
7) Except in a numeric expression with an integer and a fraction,               
   spaces between elements are optional.                                        
                                                                                
       example-  4inx3c = 4 in x 3 c = 4 inches x 3 cols

    These elements are maintained on the SPACE screen and kept

  Generally, a total number of units can be calculated even if the              
two unit descriptors are different. This can be useful for rate                 
lookups. For instance, a size of 6 col x 5 cm = 30 scc's and we                 
can calculate the rate if we know the single scc cost. Of course,               
the cost for such a space may not be equal to 30 times the scc rate.            
More on this below.                                                             
                                                                                
   Each unit descriptor will be represented by a one-byte                       
internal code found in the global tables.                                       
                                                                                
<h0>the additional description                                                  
  The additonal description can be used for several purposes-                   
                                                                                
     - UPRIGHT   - for fractional pages that are vertically oriented.           
     - VERT      -      ''                                                      
     - FLAT      - for fractional pages that are horizonatally                  
                   oriented.                                                    
     - HORIZ     -      ''                                                      
     - SOLUS     -    ??                                                        
     - TITLE CORNER - ??                                                        
     - etc.                                                                     
                                                                                
   In some cases the description can be used alone, without a size              
expression.                                                                     
                                                                                
   This extra description should probably be left basically                     
free-form, but certain standards should be adhered to when the                  
rate cards are entered. The end-users should be aware of these                  
standards.                                                                      
                                                                                
<h0>lookups based on space description                                          
   The space description of an advert is used to look up rates and              
mechanical details. Other attributes like colour, special edition,              
etc. are also involved in the lookup but are dealt with in another              
section.                                                                        
                                                                                
  Lookups based on the size expression do not match based on the                
actual way the user entered it but rather on the internal                       
representation.                                                                 
                                                                                
    Lookups based on the description should match on as many                    
characters as are given in the search argument.  The whole lookup               
procedure should be based on a flexible, intelligent attempt to                 
figure out what the user means.                                                 
                                                                                
   The lookup algorithm should be prepared to handle the following              
situations-                                                                     
                                                                                
    1) both a size and a description are given in the rate card, but            
       only one is present in the buy description. Should we return             
       the first (often only) entry that matches on what we have?               
       Should we return both parts?                                             
       For example, 1/2 PG VERT in the rate card and just 1/2 PG                
       in the buy.                                                              
                                                                                
    2) both size and description are stated in the buy but only                 
       one in the rate card.                                                    
                                                                                
   Another area of confusion has to do with a number of entries in              
BRAD where a variety of specific spaces, like 380mm x 2 cols,                   
are listed with prices. The prices may or may not be equal to                   
to what you would get using the unit rate stated - it's sometimes               
more, sometimes less. In any case, I don't know if the implication is           
that only those specific spaces are sold, or whether they are just              
listed as examples. Does it mean we should allow people to buy                  
only those spaces? The whole subject of disallowing spaces not                  
spelled out in the rate card is interesting and deserves study.

   This screen is used to define the spaces sold by the publication.            
Once this is done all other screens that involve entering data                  
by space (such as rate tables) will appear with the set of defined
