LOAD/DUMP - GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                                 
*------------------------------                                                 
         SPACE 2                                                                
DMLDMOD IS A GENERALISED CONTROLLER MODULE FOR FILE MAINTENANCE FUNCTIONS ON A  
PAIR OF FILES. THE PAIR OF FILES COMPRISE A FIXED LENGTH INDEX SEQUENTIAL FILE  
WHICH IS A DIRECTORY FOR A VARIABLE LENGTH DIRECT ACCESS FILE. THIS FILE        
STRUCTURE IS COMMON TO SEVERAL DDS SYSTEMS EG. SPTDIR/SPTFILE, PRTDIR/PRTFILE,  
REPDIR/REPFILE, MEDIR/MEDFILE.                                                  
         SPACE 1                                                                
THE INDEX SEQUENTIAL FILE (WHICH WILL BE CALLED SYSDIR) HAS RECORDS WHICH       
CONTAIN A KEY, CONTROL BYTES, AND A DISK ADDRESS. THE DISK ADDRESS MUST BE THE  
LAST FOUR BYTES AND MUST POINT TO A RECORD IN THE DIRECT ACCESS FILE (WHICH WILL
BE CALLED SYSFILE). THE DIRECT ACCESS FILE HAS RECORDS WHICH CONTAIN THE KEY,   
RECORD LENGTH, CONTROL BYTES, AND ELEMENTS.                                     
         SPACE 1                                                                
THE INDEX SEQUENTIAL FILE CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE RECORD POINTING TO A RECORD IN 
THE DIRECT ACCESS FILE. THOSE RECORDS IN SYSDIR WHOSE KEY DIFFER FROM THE KEY OF
SYSFILE ARE CALLED PASSIVE POINTERS. PASSIVE POINTERS ARE IGNORED WHEN SYSFILE  
IS COPIED TO TAPE, AND ARE RECREATED IN SYSDIR WHEN SYSFILE IS COPIED BACK TO   
DISK.                                                                           
         SPACE 1                                                                
DMLDMOD CAN ALSO BE USED FOR FILE MAINTENANCE ON A SINGLE INDEX SEQUENTIAL FILE,
IE. WHERE THERE IS NO ASSOCIATED DIRECT ACCESS FILE.                            
         SPACE 1                                                                
THE FILE MAINTENANCE FUNCTIONS ARE DEFINED BY PARAMETER CARDS WHICH SPECIFY THE 
MODE AND OPTIONS. WHEN IN COPY MODE, DMLDMOD CAN BE USED TO COPY A FILE FROM    
DISK TO TAPE (DUMP) OR FROM TAPE TO DISK (LOAD) OR FROM TAPE TO TAPE. WHEN IN   
REPORT MODE, DMLDMOD WILL READ A FILE FROM DISK OR TAPE AND PRODUCE PRINTED     
REPORTS AS SPECIFIED BY THE PARAMETER OPTIONS.                                  
         SPACE 1                                                                
ALL OUTPUT TAPES PRODUCED BY DMLDMOD ARE UNLABELED LOGICAL TAPES. LOGICAL MEANS 
THAT THE TAPE CONTAINS BLOCKED LOGICAL FILE RECORDS. DMLDMOD WILL ACCEPT AS AN  
INPUT TAPE EITHER A LOGICAL TAPE OR A LABELED PHYSICAL TAPE PRODUCED BY THE     
SAVRES SYSTEM. A SAVRES TAPE CAN ONLY BE SPECIFIED FOR A DIRECT ACCESS FILE.    
         SPACE 1                                                                
A LOAD/DUMP PROGRAM IS CREATED FOR A FILE SET BY LINK EDITING DMLDMOD WITH A SET
OF MODULES THAT DEFINE THE FILES AND THE REPORT INFORMATION. IF THE FILES ARE   
SYSDIR AND SYSFILE THE LOAD/DUMP PROGRAM WILL BE CALLED SYSLD. THE EXTERNAL     
MODULES REQUIRED WILL BE DEFINED LATER.                                         
         EJECT

TO SPECIFY AN ACTION FOR THE LOAD/DUMP PROGRAM A SET OF PARAMETERS OF THE FORMAT
KEYWORD=VALUE,KEYWORD=VALUE,... MUST BE SPECIFIED. THE FIRST KEYWORD MUST BE    
MODE= AND START IN COLUMN ONE OF THE FIRST CARD IN A SET OF CARDS. OTHER        
KEYWORDS CAN FOLLOW ON AS MANY CARDS AS IS REQUIRED. KEYWORDS ON A SINGLE CARD  
MUST BE SEPERATED BY A COMMA, MUST START IN COLUMN ONE, AND THE LAST KEYWORD ON 
A CARD MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A SPACE.

THE LIST OF KEYWORDS IS DEFINED BELOW. A KEYWORD CAN BE SPECIFIED BY A MINIMUM  
OF IT'S FIRST TWO CHARACTERS AND BY A MAXIMUM OF ITS FULL NAME. THE VALUE OF THE
OPERAND CAN BE SPECIFIED IN FULL OR IN SOME CASES BY A SHORTER VERSION.

MODE=COPY           INDICATES THAT DATA IS TO BE COPIED FROM ONE STORAGE MEDIUM 
    =COPYD          TO ANOTHER. COPYD MEANS THAT ONLY SYSDIR DATA IS TO BE      
    =COPYF          REFERENCED AND THAT IF AN INPUT TAPE IS SPECIFIED IT MUST   
                    BE A LOGICAL DUMP TAPE OF SYSDIR. COPYF MEANS THAT ONLY     
                    SYSFILE DATA IS TO BE REFERENCED AND THAT THE INPUT MUST BE 
                    A LOGICAL OR SAVRES TAPE. COPY MEANS THAT BOTH FILES ARE    
                    REFERENCED AS IN A NORMAL DUMP OR LOAD.

                    PARAMETER LIST. THIS MEANS THAT P1+1(3) IS THE ADDRESS OF

AN OUTPUT TAPE FROM THE LOAD/DUMP PROGRAM CONSISTS OF LOGICAL FILE RECORDS.     
THE TAPE IS UNLABELED, WITH VARIABLE LENGTH BLOCKS, BLOCK SIZE OF 8200 BYTES.   
THE TAPE CONTAINS EITHER FIXED LENGTH I/S FILE RECORDS (IF MODE=COPYD) OR

AN INPUT TAPE TO THE LOAD/DUMP PROGRAM CAN BE A LOGICAL TAPE AS DEFINED FOR AN  
OUTPUT TAPE, OR A PHYSICAL DUMP TAPE PRODUCED BY THE SAVRES FACILITY. A SAVRES

AN EXAMPLE OUTPUT FROM A FILE DUMP IS GIVEN BELOW. THE INDEX SEQUENTIAL FILE    
HAS TEN BYTE RECORDS (KEY=5 BYTES, CONTROL=1 BYTE, DISK ADDRESS=4 BYTES). ALL   
RECORD DISPLAYS ARE IN HEXADECIMAL. A DIRECT ACCESS FILE RECORD IS PRINTED WITH 
ITS KEY, CONTROL DATA (LENGTH=2 BYTES, CONTROL=1 BYTE, LINK ADDRESS=4 BYTES),   
AND INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS (ID=1 BYTE, LENGTH=1 BYTE, DATA=N BYTES). IF AN ELEMENT 
IS LONGER THAN 52 BYTES, THE FIRST FIFTY DATA BYTES ARE PRINTED AFTER THE ID AND
LENGTH, AND REMAINING DATA IS PRINTED 50 BYTES PER LINE.

THE SECOND ERROR BELOW SHOWS A KEY NOT EQUAL IE. THE KEY IN THE I/S FILE DOES   
NOT EQUAL THE KEY IN THE D/A FILE RECORD TO WHICH IT POINTS. THE FIRST LINE     
SHOWS THE I/S FILE RECORD. THE SECOND LINE SHOWS THE D/A FILE KEY. THE THIRD    
LINE SHOWS THE D/A FILE LENGTH,CONTROL, AND LINK. THE FORTH AND FOLLOWING LINES

THE FIFTH ERROR BELOW SHOWS AN I/S FILE RECORD WHOSE DISK ADDRESS FIELD HAS AN  
INVALID VALUE IE. IT POINTS TO A RECORD IN THE D/A FILE WHICH DOES NOT EXIST.   
A 'NOT FOUND' ERROR ON THE D/A FILE IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE FATAL.

THE SIXTH ERROR BELOW SHOWS AN I/S FILE RECORD WHICH POINTS TO A D/A FILE RECORD
WITH AN INVALID LINK FIELD. THE D/A FILE LINK FIELD IS NON ZERO IF THE D/A FILE 
RECORD HAS BEEN EXTENDED ON-LINE, AND POINTS TO THE CURRENT RECORD. A LINK

         SPACE 1                                                                
If an external is specified a message is ALWAYS sent to the console to inform   
that this load/dump is using an external, and whether or not the external is, or
has been set, no-op. Message is one of the following:                           
         SPACE 1                                                                
     EXTERNAL external IS ACTIVE                                                
     EXTERNAL external IS NO-OP                                                 
         SPACE 1                                                                
In all cases if a msg is put to the console it is also printed on SYSLIST.      
         SPACE 1                                                                
It is hoped that VERIFY=YES will prevent the accidental call of an external for 
the wrong system, and that last weekend's external will not be run this weekend 
because it was not no-op'ed or removed from the load parms!!
