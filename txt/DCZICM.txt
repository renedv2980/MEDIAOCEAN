Macro generates       SR   RX,RX                                                
                      ICM  RX,M,ADDR                                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
Two forms are available:                                                        
                                                                                
1)   ZICM  RX,ADDR,N                                                            
                                                                                
     which replaces the low order N bytes of RX with N contiguous bytes from    
     ADDR.                                                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
2)   ZICM  RX,ADDR,(M)                                                          
                                                                                
     where M is 1-F, a hex mask under control of which bytes from ADDR are      
     inserted into RX.  I.e. (9) will replace the high and low order bytes of   
     RX with the high and low order bytes of the four at ADDR..                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
 Note: If all four bytes of the register are involved the SR instruction is     
 ----  not generated.
