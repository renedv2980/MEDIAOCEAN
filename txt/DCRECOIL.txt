A) Introduction                                                                 
---------------                                                                 
                                                                                
     DDRECOIL is an offline utility program which can be used to                
RECOVER or RERUN a job by reading the updates recorded in the system            
recovery files.                                                                 
                                                                                
     This process depends on the writing of offline Job 'Header'                
and 'Trailer' records to the recovery file. This is handled by DMRCVR           
if offline recovery is indicated in the SSB.  The Job is then specified         
to RECOIL in the JCL input control cards by its Job name and JES id.            
(If either is ommitted all jobs, or all those matching the Job name             
are included.) The RECOIL process can then search through the recovery          
file to find the block of updates between the 'Header' records, (or             
upto the optional 'Trailer' record.)                                            
                                                                                
     The program runs with one system recovery file at a time.                  
This is specified by passing the system and file code or agency                 
alpha id.                                                                       
                                                                                
     The program can run in one of two MODES. Either RERUN where all            
the changes and additions to the system file are resubmitted for the            
given jobs, or RECOVERY where all updates to the system file are backed         
out for the given Jobs. In RECOVERY mode if the JESID is specified              
as being 'THIS' then the updates made by the execution of the current           
job are backed out. This allows RECOIL to be run as a consecutive               
process within a Job, say as a conditional step taken in the event of           
an ABEND by the main Job.                                                       
                                                                                
     The program can be run by submitting JCL catalogued procedure              
RECOIL and run options are controlled by the following card data lines.         
lines:
