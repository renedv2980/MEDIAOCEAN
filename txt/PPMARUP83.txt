New Way to Direct Payments                                                   
         SPACE 2                                                                
Effective Friday, January 20, we have made several changes to how you          
override payments in the PRINTPAK Pay program.                                 
         SPACE 2                                                                
To direct payments to a Rep in the Pay program (overriding direct payment      
to the publication, or the regular Paying Rep), you must now enter 'P'         
followed by the Rep code (example: 'P2355').  Previously, you entered an       
'S'.                                                                           
         SPACE 2                                                                
To direct payments to the publication (rather than a Paying Rep), you must     
now enter 'P0000', instead of 'S0000'.                                         
         SPACE 2                                                                
These changes are being made to allow for a future enhancement which will      
enable you to enter a special rep for certain buylines in the Buy program,     
and/or enter a special Rep code in the Estimate Record.  Both of these new     
features will be released by the end of this month.
