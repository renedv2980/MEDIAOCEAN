         TITLE 'STAMPER'                                                        
                                                                                
DMSTAMP is used to insert the cpu id and/or the data space id into              
record zero of a file. The source code can be found in DMSTAMPER.               
                                                                                
Each CPU has a four chr CPU id of the format C'SYx '. So what uniquely          
identifys a CPU is the 3rd chr of the cpu id. Stamping puts this 3rd            
Cpu id chr into reczero+6.                                                      
                                                                                
Each DDS file has info about it held in a data space local to a given           
CPU. The dataspace names that we are using are C'DMGA',C'DMGR',C'DMGT'          
for Adv,Rep,and Tst facpaks. The 4th letter uniquely indentifies                
the data space. Stamping puts the 4th chr of the data space id into             
reczero+7.                                                                      
                                                                                
The SYSIN input to DMSTAMP has optional parameter cards plus one card           
per file that needs to be stamped. The data on a file card is:                  
                                                                                
Cols 01-03 Cpu id - A one,two,or three chr cpu id (eg. 1,S1. or SY1)            
Cols 04-11 File id                                                              
Col  12    Data space id                                                        
                                                                                
If Cols 1-3 are left blank or set to ... then the cpuid field in rec            
zero will not be changed. If the first chr is set to an & sighn then a          
CPUID= param card must have been input previously, and the value on             
this param card will be used.                                                   
                                                                                
If Cols 12 is left blank or set to . then the dspace id field in rec            
zero will not be changed. If col 12 is set to an & sign,then a                  
DSPACE= param card must have been input previously, and the value               
on this param card will be used.                                                
                                                                                
The parameter cards are as follows                                              
                                                                                
DDSIO=........ To name a different DDSIO module from the standard one           
CPUID=...      To name a cpu id for subsequent use                              
DSPACE=.       To name a data space id chr for subsequent use                   
GLOBAL=Y       To set the next file(s) named as global files                    
GLOBAL=N       To set the next file(s) named as local files                     
WRITE=N        Stop the stamp data being written to the files                   
FORCE=Y        Forces an override to the rules of stamping                      
OVERRIDE       Same as FORCE=Y                                                  
                                                                                
DMSTAMP must be run in the same CPU as the one where the file(s) are            
currently stamped. If a file is stamped as being owned by SY1 them              
DMSTAMP must be run in SY1 in order to change the current stamp. This           
can be over ridden by a FORCE=Y or OVERRIDE card.                               
                                                                                
If we are changing the stamp to another CPU, or setting the stamp to            
zero, and the file is global, DMSTAMP will look in this CPU's data space        
and check if any jobs are still running on the system to which the file         
belongs.                                                                        
                                                                                
If the system to which the file belongs is open, a message is put to the        
operator's console asking for action. The standard action should be to          
fix the problem (ie stop the system if it is still up) and to type              
RETRY to the message. If the problem can not be fixed then the reply of         
CANCEL will cancel the STAMPER step, and the current file plus those            
named after it in the SYSIN deck will not be stamped. If FORCE=Y is             
specified the operator will not be asked and an IGNORE reply will be            
forced, but a message is printed about the event.
