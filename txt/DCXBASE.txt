         TITLE 'XBASE'                                                          
                                                                                
Macro that generates a set of code to exit back to the supervisor from a module 
which is the base or root phase of a program. Any module initialized by NBASE   
should exit via XBASE.                                                          
                                                                                
(Name)   XBASE  (RC=retcode)(,RL=retlen)                                        
                                                                                
RF is set to the return code specified by the RC= parameter. If the RC=         
parameter is omitted a return code of zero is passed in RF. If RC=(Rx) is quoted
then RF is set to the value in Rx. If RC=label is quoted then RF is set to the  
full word value in the storage area named by the label. If the return code in   
label is not a full word, then specify the length in bytes (1-4) with the       
RL=retlen parameter. If, for example, the program keeps a one byte return code  
in the field RETCDE then code:                                                  
                                                                                
         XBASE   RC=RETCDE,RL=1
