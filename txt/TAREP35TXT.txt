*           a)  If corresponding fixed cycle payment has amount       *         
*               override defined on cast record then credits are      *         
*               taken based on ftrack balance. (Note this causes      *         
*               WRITE=NO reports to not reflect payments accurately.) *         
*           b)  Otherwise credits are calculated by taking the        *         
*               difference between what was originally taken and a    *         
*               new session payment.  (Note that this logic is flawed *         
*               if there are multiple reuse payments with credits.)   *         
*                                                                     *

*  -> Retro session payments upgrade Ftrack balances by the increase  *         
*     in the basic session amount only (extra details are ignored.)   *

*  -> In 94 Aftra radio contract, BSR rates increased by 13%, but     *         
*     reuse rates increased by only 4%.  Therefore, if Ftrack balance *         
*     equals 0, don't pay rate increase to BSR, just P&H increase,    *         
*     and for the corresponding reuse payments, don't apply credits   *

*     rates for all reuse that apply credits increased by at least    *         
*     the same dollar amount or their base rate was more than the     *         
*     session rate.  Therefore, if Ftrack balance = 0, don't pay      *         
*     rate increase to sessions if there's no Ot, Dt, Travl, Pd-wd,   *

*     the original invoice.  (This was a bug in the 94 retro run and  *         
*     needs to be coded before running retros again).                 *
