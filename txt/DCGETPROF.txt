Module will check control file to see if user profiles exist for specified      
agency/media/client for a program.                                              
                                                                                
Parameter 1    byte 0        Indicator byte as follows:-                        
                             X'80' means the indicator byte is present          
                             X'40'=return default profile if agency             
                                   level profile not found                      
                             X'20'=P5 contains A(info block described below)    
                             X'10'=use agency profile (not user id)             
                             X'2F' bits are reserved for future features        
                                                                                
                             (ie code X'C0' for default profile feature)

     for those of us too daft to understand the above, make                     
     sure you turn on the x'80' bit with any of the above, or                   
     your parameters will be ignored!
