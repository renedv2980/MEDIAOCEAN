         TITLE 'SORTER'                                                         
DDSORTER module provides an active interface to IBM Sort DFSORT so that         
a sort can be scheduled within a user program.                                  
                                                                                
More than one sort can be activated, but not concurrently.                      
                                                                                
Important mediaocean installation defaults:                                     
Variable-length records default to an *order-preserving* sort.                  
Fixed-length records default to a *NON*-order-preserving sort.                  
See "OPTION EQUALS" in the DFSORT manual for more details.                      
                                                                                
Basic call to SORTER requires two parameters. Special features require          
the use of a third parameter. The presence of a third parameter requires        
that P2(1) is set to X'80'.                                                     
                                                                                
The first feature is to get all the details of what actions DFSORT took         
during the sort. This is listed in DFSMSG SYSOUT data set.                      
If P3(1) is set to X'80' SORTER will output DFSORT activity data set.           
                                                                                
The second feature is to stop SORTER abending when it gets a non-zero           
return code from DFSORT.                                                        
If P3(1) is set to X'40' SORTER will return the abend code in P3+3(1).          
                                                                                
To initialize a sort                                                            
--------------------                                                            
Param 1  A(sort card)   CL80'SORT FIELDS= etc.                                  
Param 2  A(record card) CL80'RECORD TYPE= etc.                                  
                                                                                
The extra parameters can be set in the initialize call. These values            
will be saved by SORTER and used for GET/PUT calls.

Param 2  Will be filled by sorter with addr of rec or zeros at EOF              
                                                                                
To end the sort

Param 2  n/a
