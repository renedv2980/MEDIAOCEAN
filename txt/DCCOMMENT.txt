The COMMENT macro is used to create blocks of comments. The comment             
block begins with the statement COMMENT and ends with the statement             
ENDCOMM. E.g.:                                                                  
                                                                                
         <some code>                                                            
         COMMENT                                                                
         <this code is commented out>                                           
         ENDCOMM                                                                
         <more code>
