<lines>                                                                         
<t>rates                                                                        
   To look up the rates for an advert we need to know-                          
                                                                                
     1) which rate card to use- based on the date the advert runs.              
                                                                                
     2) what discount level the client is entitled to.                          
                                                                                
     3) the space description.                                                  
                                                                                
     4) what 'specials' apply- e.g. geographic edition, position,               
        colours, etc.                                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
  Most rate data is kept in tables, or two-dimensional arrays of                
cells. A common table is one that consists of space descriptions as             
rows and discount levels as columns - but in fact the rows and                  
columns can be any of a number of things.                                       
                                                                                
  Some examples of possible rate tables-

  -------            --------

  discount levels    days                                                       
  geo editions       colours                                                    
                                                                                
<h0>qualifying tables by 'specials'                                             
   A table can be entered for a particular geographic edition,                  
section, number of colours, classified, etc. by qualifying it with              
'specials'.  See SPECIALS section for more.                                     
                                                                                
   Within a pub and rate card date, the specials along with the                 
row and column definitions constitute the logical 'key' of the                  
table.                                                                          
                                                                                
   When a table is displayed all the specials used to qualify it                
are displayed. They can be changed.                                             
                                                                                
   On a DISPLAY the user need not enter the whole set of qualifiers-            
we can show him the first one that matches as much as he put in. Of             
course he can also display via a list/select.                                   
                                                                                
   There may be some nasty programming difficulties involved in both            
the file maintenance and the rate lookup algorithm in trying to                 
determine if the tables that exist make sense taken as a whole                  
as far as their qualifying specials are concerned.  It may be                   
hard to tell if conflicting data as been entered.                               
                                                                                
<h0>rows/columns                                                                
   The inputter defines what kind of things are to be the rows and              
columns of the table. Once he does that the actual row and column               
items are pre-listed for him.                                                   
                                                                                
  The possibilities are-                                                        
                                                                                
     1) space         - the whole set of spaces defined for the                 
                        pub on the SPACE screen. (rows only)                    
                                                                                
     2) disc or       - the discount levels                                     
        disc=xxxxxxxx   (for discount code xxxxxxxx)                            
                                                                                
     3) specials      - any type of special, e.g. GEO, DAY, SECT,               
                        COLOUR, etc. All the individual entries                 
                        for the type are pre-listed.                            
                                                                                
     4) bleed         - to enter special bleed charges.                         
                        (single column only)                                    
                                                                                
     5) blank         - to specify a single column rate table.                  
                                                                                
  Each choice for rows and columns will require slightly special                
treatment when it comes to displaying them on the screen- different             
formats and sizes. For the most part I don't think it will be too               
bad.                                                                            
                                                                                
  We will probably need some rules about what combinations of                   
specials and rows and columns are not to be allowed. Some                       
could never make any sense.                                                     
                                                                                
  Whatever is used as a row or column cannot be also used as a                  
special for the same table.                                                     
                                                                                
<h0>lists                                                                       
  The list screen for tables will show the row and column data types            
and the specials that qualify the table.                                        
                                                                                
<h0>screen control                                                              
   The table should be treated as a spreadsheet. We will need                   
vertical and horizontal scrolling. Scrolling should not cause                   
changes to be written back to the file- that should happen only                 
when you hit ENTER.                                                             
                                                                                
<h0>rates                                                                       
   This field is used to describe the type of rates being entered.              
                                                                                
      +%     - surcharges expressed as percents.                                
      -%     - discounts expressed as percents.                                 
      +      - surcharges expressed as an amount.                               
      -      - discounts expressed as an amount.                                
      blank  - actual costs.                                                    
                                                                                
   The section on the rate lookup algorithm explains how these                  
are used.                                                                       
                                                                                
    The last three above may be followed by a size unit descriptor              
 (inch, scc, sci, mm, etc.) to indicate that the rates are so much              
 per unit.                                                                      
                                                                                
    Any of the above can be followed by a digit to indicate the                 
precision of the data. (0=units, 1=.0, 2=.00, etc.).                            
                                                                                
    There should be system defaults for the above.                              
                                                                                
    All the cells in a table must be of the same type and precision.            
<h0>table cells                                                                 
  Basically the cells contain rates. They may also contain, in                  
addition to or instead of rates-                                                
                                                                                
    R       - required. e.g. in a bleed charge table, r would                   
              mean that whatever was in the row (space, most likely)            
              can only be bought as a bleed.                                    
                                                                                
    NA      - not available.                                                    
                                                                                
    OA      - on application.                                                   
                                                                                
    NC      - no charge.                                                        
                                                                                
   If a cell is left blank we could just treat that as NC. A more               
interesting possiblity is to try and fill it in for the inputter.               
For instance, if we have the scc rate and the space left blank is               
equivalent to a certain number of scc's, we could do the calculation.           
Maybe we should do this only if he specifically asks us to.                     
                                                                                
<h0>display based on discount %'s                                               
   See section on discount structures.                                          
                                                                                
   If the volume discount structure is expressed in terms of %'s                
(as it almost always seems to be in the UK), you obviously need                 
to enter only the open rates- the discounted ones are calculated.               
                                                                                
   It would be nice to use our table screens to display these                   
discounted rates however. It's just a matter of displaying a table              
that isn't really there.                                                        
                                                                                
   There might be reason to add a full table with spaces as rows and            
discount levels as columns even if the discounts are expressed in               
percents. We could fill in the table with the calculated rates. The             
inputter could make any necessary adjustments.

   For each unique table 'key' a 2-byte internal code is                        
sequentially assigned.                                                          
                                                                                
   The 'key' consists of the row and column types plus any                      
associated qualifying 'specials' elements.                                      
                                                                                
   The row and column types are kept in table header elements which             
look like this-

    The codes for the row and column types and the unit are got from            
the system global tables.                                                       
                                                                                
    The only use I have thought of for the additional code for rows             
and columns is for volume discount schemes when there is more than              
one. I'm sure there will be others.                                             
                                                                                
   Qualifying specials elements are described in the SPECIALS                   
section. Space is not truly a 'special' but could be treated as one             
for this purpose, i.e. a table could theoretically consist of                   
various rates for only one space type.                                          
                                                                                
     These elements (both types) could logically be kept in either              
  of two places (or both?)-                                                     
                                                                                
     1) In the rate card header record where they would serve as                
        a handy directory of tables.                                            
                                                                                
     2) In each individual table record.                                        
                                                                                
     The problem with 2 is that we might have to read the whole                 
 set of table records to find the one we want. The table record                 
keys will have a 2-byte internal table code, but that won't tell                
us what the table consists of. Some info could be kept in the                   
control bytes, of course.                                                       
                                                                                
    The problem with 1 is that the programming is more awkward                  
and it might be hard to keep the list of id elements in sync with               
the records.                                                                    
                                                                                
<h0>Table dimension elements                                                    
    Kept in the individual table records.                                       
                                                                                
    These elements contain a list of the actual items that make up              
the rows and columns, which might be only a subset all the items for            
that type. For instance, the rows for a table may be space                      
descriptions but some may have been excluded. Also new space                    
descriptions may have been added to the rate card since the                     
table was last changed.                                                         
                                                                                
   This whole area will no doubt present some programming                       
difficulties.

<h0>Table cell elements                                                         
                                                                                
     Kept in individual table records.                                          
                                                                                
    The data is the set of cells, the question is how to                        
    group them.                                                                 
                                                                                
     We can either have each cell be a separate element, or                     
     create large elements of many cells which saves some space                 
     but is more work.                                                          
                                                                                
     However we do it, the elements don't need to contain anything              
     but cell data; the row and column is determined by the                     
     relative position of the cell. We can either keep them in                  
     order across rows or down columns.

<t>rate lookup algorithm                                                        
  This is a rather complicated procedure which basically involves               
looking to see what tables are available, which ones are relevant               
to the buy at hand, and deciding what order to use them in.                     
With a correctly set up rate card it shoula always be fairly                    
obvious what to do.                                                             
                                                                                
1) Finding the basic rate.                                                      
                                                                                
     First find the basic, open rate for the space. Try first for an            
   exact match on space description. If not there, look for the unit            
   rate for the size unit of the space and multiply by the number of            
   units. For instance, if the space is 3 cols x 5 cms and we can               
   find a scc rate, we are ok.                                                  
                                                                                
   This open rate will most often come from a table with spaces as              
   rows and rate (or discount levels) as columns and with actual                
   costs, not +/- charges or percents.  There may be several such               
   tables and we have to select the right one based on the                      
   'specials' for the buy. For example, if the buy is for a specific            
   geographic edition and there exists a table like this for that               
   edition, we have to use it.  If the rate card is properly set up             
   there should be one table that is obviously correct to use.                  
                                                                                
   The basic cost might also be found in a table of, say,                       
   discount levels by day of week edition which has been entered                
   for a specific space (or more likely a size unit like scc), but              
   I think this will be fairly unusual, at least in the UK.                     
                                                                                
2) Applying surcharges and discounts.                                           
                                                                                
    Once we have the basic cost we can look for adjustments. The idea           
  is to look for tables that involve the special attributes of the              
  buy, find the right cell, and add or subtract the adjustment.                 
                                                                                
   One difficulty is deciding in what order to apply the adjustments.           
  It doesn't make too much difference if they are all in percents               
  or all in amounts, but it does if there is a mixture. This may                
  be a simple rate card option stating which type is done first, or             
  there may be a set sequence, or maybe the situation never comes up.           
  In any case, it probably isn't often stated in the rate cards.                
                                                                                
    At this stage we do not consider tables that have actual costs,             
  only those with adjustments (% or amounts).                                   
                                                                                
    In the rate card header are sort of global rates for bleed,                 
  position, split-run, and color. If any of these are part of the               
  buy but nothing specific is found in the tables, then the global              
  adjustment should be applied.                                                 
                                                                                
3) What to do when the rates aren't there.                                      
                                                                                
    If the buy has a specific section, for instance, and there                  
are no special rates by section in the rate card, that's fine-                  
it just means that there isn't any extra charge. If there are                   
rates by section but none for this particular section that might                
also be ok, but it might mean that the buyer spelled the section                
code or description wrong. This area has to be looked into.                     
                                                                                
   We also have to decide what to do when we find an OA (on                     
 application) as a rate.                                                        
                                                                                
   If we find a NA (not available) we must at least warn the buyer.             
                                                                                
   There may be cases where it is an error not to find a table                  
with rates for a particular attribute. For instance, if a pub                   
is sold in various geographic editions there should always be                   
special rates for them.
