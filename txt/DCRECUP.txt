         TITLE 'RECUP'                                                          
Module will add an element to a record if the element address is outside the    
record, or delete an element if the element address is within the record.       
                                                                                
After RECUP, the record length is updated to reflect the appropriate change.

To avoid destructive loops, RECUP is designed to blow up with an operation      
exception when insertion or deletion addresses are not in a valid element       
position within the record or when an attempt is made to add a zero length      
element.
