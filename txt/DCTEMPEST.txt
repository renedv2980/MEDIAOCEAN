         TITLE 'Tempest - Online Temporary Extended Storage'                    
Introduction                                                                    
------------                                                                    
TEMPEST is a DDS disk file used for online temporary extra storage.             
It is divided into control intervals. Each control interval contains            
three 18432 byte records/pages. An online program can reserve space in          
TEMPEST by the data manager command DMRSRV and can release unwanted             
space with the DMRLSE command. Records can be read and written by the           
data manager commands DMREAD and DMWRT. A control interval for TEMPEST          
if fixed as one track. The maximum TEMPEST that can be reserved is              
8 tracks. The TEMPEST belongs to a session so that a terminal with              
muliple sessions connected can have multiple TEMPEST allocations. When          
a session is disconnected the TEMPEST is returned back to the pool.             
                                                                                
DMRSRV                                                                          
------                                                                          
An online task can make several reserves. Each reserve will aquire an           
integral number of control intervals (trks) as long as the task does            
not exceed the maximum allowed. The number of trks required is passed           
in DMCBW3(1). If the caller wants to work with pages (18K recs) then            
set DMCBW3+1(1)=C'P' and set the number of pages required in DMCBW3(1).         
Note that the whole number of trks required will be computed and that           
a request for 8 pages will aquire 3 trks ie 9 pages.If RF contains the          
number of trks requested a sample calling sequence is :                         
                                                                                
         GOTO1 =V(DATAMGR),DMCB,=C'DMRSRV',=C'TEMPEST',((RF),0),0               
                                                                                
DMCBW3(1) is set to X'00' on a successful reserve or to X'80' if request        
exceeds maximum allowed or no space exists in TEMPEST.A reserve for zero        
pages is considered a successful call. The following info is passed back        
in DMCBW3 and DMCBW4 on a successful call :                                     
                                                                                
DMCBW3+0(2)=Number of trks reserved this call                                   
DMCBW3+2(2)=Number of records per track (pages per control interval)            
DMCBW4+0(2)=Total num of trks reserved in previous calls                        
DMCBW4+2(2)=Maximum number of trks allowed per task                             
                                                                                
The first reserve will always allocate the maximum number of trks of            
TEMPEST. This is currently 8 tracks or 24 pages.                                
                                                                                
DMRLSE                                                                          
------                                                                          
An online task can make several releases. Each release will return an           
integral number of control intervals (trks) back to the TEMPEST pool of         
available pages. The number of trks to be released is passed in                 
DMCBW3(1). If the caller wants to work with pages (6k records) then             
set DMCBW3+1(1)=C'P' and the number of pages to release in DMCBW3(1).           
Note that the whole number or trks required will be computed and that           
a release of 3 pages will release 1 CI ie 7 pages.If RF contains the            
number of trks to release then a sample calling sequence is :                   
                                                                                
         GOTO1 =V(DATAMGR),DMCB,=C'DMRLSE',=C'TEMPEST',((RF),0),0               
                                                                                
If the call specifies no trks/pages to release then no action is taken          
except that DMCBW3 and DMCBW4 are set as defined below. If the call             
specifies that X'FF' or 255 trks/pages are to be released then ALL trks         
owned by that task are released. If the number of trks specified to             
release exceeds the number of trks reserved then all of the trks reserved       
will be released.                                                               
                                                                                
DMCBW3(1) is set to X'00' on a successful release.The following                 
info is passed back in DMCBW3 and DMCBW4 on a successful call :

A logical page number (the first page is one) is specified in DMCBW3(1)         
If the page number exceeds the number of pages reserved then X'80' eof          
will be returned in DMCBW3(1). If RF contains the required page number          
sample code is as follows :

A logical page number (the first page is one) is specified in DMCBW3(1)

Passing TEMPEST storage to another session/program                              
--------------------------------------------------                              
The current TEMPEST allocation held by the current session can be found         
with the following GETFACT call                                                 
                                                                                
         LHI   R0,F#XTGET                                                       
         GOTO1 CGETFACT,PARM,(X'80',TEMPINF),(R0)                               
                                                                                
where TEMPINF is an eight chr field. If TEMPINF is passed to another            
session or program via a GLOBBER call then the other program can gain           
access to the passed TEMPEST by the following GETFACT call                      
                                                                                
         LHI   R0,F#XTSET                                                       
         GOTO1 CGETFACT,PARM,(X'80',TEMPINF),(R0)                               
                                                                                
In this case the receiving program can now do DMREADs and DMWRTs as             
above. It can not DMRSRV or DMRLSE this TEMPEST (as it does not own it)         
or aquire any for its own usage.
