Note- the ideas mentioned here have not been                                    
      incorporated into the body of this document                               
      or MPMAGREP.                                                              
                                                                                
1. BASE.  Affects the COMP data items. Previously I had thought that the        
          comp (composition) for a pub meant simply the proportion of           
          the vehicle's total readership (VRDR) represented by the              
          target (COMP= AUD/VRDR).                                              
                                                                                
          If a BASE is specified, however, the VRDR is the total vehicle        
          readership within that base definition.                               
                                                                                
          For instance, if the target were cigar smoking men the base           
          might be all men, instead of all people. The rank report              
          example for JWT illustrates this.                                     
                                                                                
2. Adjustment factors.                                                          
                                                                                
          This area has been simplified somewhat.                               
                                                                                
          Previously I had made a distinction between imp adjustment            
          factors and circulation adjustment factors. I now feel that           
          they should be combined.                                              
                                                                                
          Also, I no longer think it is necessary to be able to                 
          show both 'adjusted' and 'unadjusted' data on a report.               
          Why show unadjusted data at all?                                      
                                                                                
          It is necessary, howvever, to show the adjustment factors             
          themselves- as a column on some reports (RANK, SCHEDULE)              
          or as a stub on others (REACH, VXV).                                  
                                                                                
3. Schedule recap.                                                              
                                                                                
          We should have the ability to do multiple schedules one               
          after the other and to print a one-line recap for each.               
                                                                                
          Unfortunately, this recap is almost another report type               
          which needs to be defined by the user. Maybe we can find              
          some way to base the format of the recap on the format                
          of the schedule report itself.                                        
                                                                                
          We may want an option to supress printing the full                    
          schedule reports and just print the recap.                            
                                                                                
          See the JWT sample book for an example of all this.                   
                                                                                
4. Nomenclature.                                                                
                                                                                
          We should replace REACH with COV (coverage) in most places.           
                                                                                
          OTS (opportunities-too-see) is used in addition to or                 
          instead of IMPS.                                                      
                                                                                
          Frequency weights are more often called response functions.           
                                                                                
 5. Schedule total data.                                                        
                                                                                
           There isn't much in my documentation that illustrates                
           this. The idea is that there is some data which doesn't              
           logically appear as columns in the body of the report                
           but only prints at the end (average frequency, for                   
           instance).                                                           
                                                                                
           The media guy from Dorland's said it would be very useful            
           to show the N+ coverage right with the report, as well as            
           part of the frequency distribution report. In other words,           
           along with the total coverage we might show the number of            
           people reached 4 or more times. Maybe this could be                  
           something like 4+COV as a data item on the request screen.           
           Maybe it should also be a column on the schedule recap.

  A routine called the 'parser' will analyze the data item specs                
from the request. It will use this table to validate the Base/                  
Qualifier combinations and the precision and weight instructions.

calculations and the printing of the data.

  Each 'vector' should be thought of as a 'record'.                             
                                                                                
  All the vectors will be held in core, permitting easy calculation             
and ranking. The printing order of the vectors is controlled through            
the SORT option.                                                                
                                                                                
  For the COMPARE, REACH, and VXV reports each data vector is for a             
vehicle.                                                                        
                                                                                
  For the EVAL report each data vector is for an insertion.                     
                                                                                
  For the FREQ report each data vector is for a specific number of              
exposures. The program will need to be able to group the vectors                
for printing. Each vector data item has a suffix designating whether            
it is for N,0-N,1-N,or N+ exposures.                                            
                                                                                
  For the REACH report each 'suffixable' data item is repeated for              
each issue count.                                                               
                                                                                
  For the VXV report each 'suffixable' data item is repeated for each           
paired vehicle. The suffix is the relative number of the paired vehicle.        
                                                                                
  For the COMPARE report RCH data items are 'suffixed' by the issue             
count.

  As each base/qualifier/weight /suffix is used -either by direct               
statement or by implication (being required for a calculation) - it is          
assigned a four byte value which is the actual displacement into the            
data vector. Its actual printing location (if any) is also derived.             
                                                                                
  The parser will also create the actual column headings.

  Built by the parser from the requested data item list and options             
using the data item menu.                                                       
                                                                                
  Multiple passes through the command table may be required-                    
                                                                                
  1. To build skeleton vectors with data from the schedule-                     
     vehicle codes and controls, and number of inserts.                         
                                                                                
  2. To flesh out the vectors with readership data- see

  3. To set the 'total' or 'overall' vector, values from which                  
     may be necessary for calculating some indices or percents.                 
                                                                                
  4. For deriving the vehicle rank numbers for certain values.                  
                                                                                
  5. For final calulations and printing.
