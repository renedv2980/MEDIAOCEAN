         TITLE 'ICM'                                                            
The ICM instruction has come into fashion.  This allows you to insert 1-4       
characters from a low-byte field into a register under the control of a mask.   
Mask values of 8, 4, 2, 1 specify first, second, third, fourth bytes and are    
added together for multiple insertion.                                          
                                                                                
One obvious use is to load 4 bytes from an area not on a full-word boundary:    
                                                                                
                        ICM  R1,15,ANYWHERE                                     
                                                                                
There is also a STCM command and, now, a ZICM macro.
