         TITLE 'DAYUNPK'                                                        
Converts the special 1-byte day field into day expression.                      
                                                                                
Parameter 1    byte 0        start-end days for out-of-week rotators.           
                             See note below.                                    
                             x'80' = Reppak (11 byte output)                    
               bytes 1-3     A(one-byte day field)                              
                                                                                
Parameter 2    byte  0       X'07' Optional - to force output to seven-byte     
                                              compressed format.                
               bytes 1-3     A(output field)                                    
                                                                                
If output expression will not fit within 8 bytes (example M,TU,TH-SA), it will  
be compressed to the format MT.TFS.                                             
                                                                                
Out-of-week rotators. Start and end days in 1st and 2nd nibbles of              
parm 1/byte 0. Use BYSEDAY in spotpak BDELEM. (Note- end day is not             
actually used by module.) Example: M-F rotator with a start day of              
3 will result in output of W-F,M-TU. Compressed 7-byte format is                
not affected.                                                                   
                                                                                
                                                                                
The on-line, core-resident version is T00A0F.
