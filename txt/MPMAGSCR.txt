   merged together, i.e. all respondents are                                    
   on a single logical file.                                                    
N= waves not merged. See WAVE screen.                                           
<fd>sample size flags.                                                          
If the unweighted sample size falls below certain                               
limits, it is usually necessary to note that fact                               
on any tables or reports.  There are normally two                               
threshholds. The actual threshhold values are                                   
entered on the WAVE screen.

The flag to appear beside the numbers on

**DDS ONLY**                                                                    
                                                                                
  Surveys may consist of multiple 'waves' or releases representing              
data collected during different survey periods. Each wave for a survey          
must be identical (or virtually so) in its code-book structure.                 
Each wave represents a different set of respondents, not the same               
set asked the same questions at a later date.                                   
                                                                                
  Waves are identified by month and year.                                       
                                                                                
  The data required by the system for a wave is entered on this screen.         
It must be added even if there is only one wave.                                
                                                                                
  Waves for a survey may be merged or not merged. Merged means that             
the different waves are combined together to appear as one respondent           
set on one logical file. Not merged means that each wave is handled             
as a separate unit, though multiple waves may be added together for             
reporting and may co-exist on the same physical file.                           
                                                                                
 Whether waves are merged or not is determined by how the files are             
made available by the survey company. NRS waves are not merged.

<h0>SCREEN INTRODUCTION                                                         
  The following screens illustrate how DDS will maintain the                    
Qspec file. They show the data involved at each level of a                      
Qspec and how the sequencing is controlled. Users will have                     
access to Qspecs on a read only basis.                                          
                                                                                
  Qspecs consist of up to three parts- Topic, Question, and Answer.             
                                                                                
  There are not, however, separate key fields for each part.  Instead,          
the complete Qspec is entered at once as TOPIC.QUESTION.ANSWER.  You            
must set up the parts individually- before you can add questions                
within a topic you must add the topic, and so forth.                            
                                                                                
  A 'Question', however, can be set up without a topic, and an 'answer'         
can be set up without a topic or question.                                      
                                                                                
  When you are adding Qspecs to the file you must identify them (in             
the RECORD field) as topics, questions, or answers. For other                   
maintenance functions a record type of QSPEC can also be used;                  
the system will automatically bring up the appropriate screen for the           
record involved.                                                                
                                                                                
  Qspecs will generally be displayed, both on screen lists and                  
cross-tab reports, in the order in which they were input, not in order          
of their alphabetic codes. This is true for topics, questions, and              
answers. The printing order can, however, be changed within each                
level. See the Qspec List screen.                                               
                                                                                
  Qspecs are related to the card/column/punch data of the survey file           
through the specification fields in which you state the logical                 
condition that defines the qspec using the Logical Specification                
Language.                                                                       
                                                                                
  There is a simple copy function available to reduce inputting. Also           
special sets of Qspecs, called 'library groups', can be set up and              
invoked over and over again, using parameter substitution to replace            
fields that change with each use. Library groups will save a lot of             
inputting, prevent errors, and conserve file space.

U  = Usage level codes. The surveys often group                                 
     the answers to questions about levels of                                   
     product use into heavy ,medium, and light

     like 'What brands do you use?' the additional                              
     codes are provides to identify people who                                  
     mention only one brand. This is a difficult

Answer class will be used primarily in cross-tab                                
specification where you might want to include or                                
exclude certain classes.

You may assign an arithmetic value (up to 2                                     
decimals) to each answer. This would be used to                                 
calculate means or medians for cross-tabs. There                                
are at least three cases where this might be                                    
done-                                                                           
                                                                                
  1. Rating scale questions- e.g. excellent(5)                                  
     to poor(1).                                                                
                                                                                
  2. Answers where a code represents a specific                                 
     arithmetic value or range of values. Enter                                 
     the value or the mid-point of the range.                                   
                                                                                
  3. Numeric fields. The answers set up as Qspecs                               
     will usually be ranges of values. Normally,                                
     you would enter the mid-point of the range.

cannot, for example, rename TOPICA.Q1 to TOPICB.Q1.

  Creating a new Qspec or entire Qspec group by copying an existing             
one and then ammending it can save a lot of inputting.

  Blocks of questions or answers that appear repeatedly in the                  
code-book and be set up once as a 'library group' of Qspecs and                 
invoked over and over again as needed. Library groups are set up as             
normal Qspecs but are identified by a $ as the first character of the           
leading Qspec. They can be a set of questions and answers to be used            
within multiple topics or a set of answers to be used within multiple           
questions.                                                                      
                                                                                
  A library group is a prototype. Each time it is invoked, certain              
information, particularly card and column numbers and perhaps part of           
the annotation will be different and will have to be supplied. Such             
items are coded as symbolic parameters in the library group and are             
replaced via parameter substitution when it is used.  Symbolic                  
parameters are entered with an '&&' as in &&CARD, &&COL, &&BRAND, etc.          
                                                                                
  The following series of screens illustrates how to set up a simple            
library group.                                                                  
<pa>                                                                            
~QSPEC                                                                          
                                                                                
~LIBRARY GROUPS AND CALLS                                                       
                                                                                
In this case the library group consists of a question and its                   
answers and so is set up as if it were a topic.

Start the listing at this target code.                                          
<fd>user id.                                                                    
The user id code acts as a filter.                                              
                                                                                
  If the filter you enter is preceeded by an '=' the target id is               
compared to it starting at position one. *'s may be used to suppress            
filtering on the positions where they occur.                                    
                                                                                
  e.g.- a filter of =AB will list all targets with id's starting with           
        'AB'.                                                                   
        =**AB will pass all those with 'AB' in positions 3 and 4.               
                                                                                
  If the filter is not preceeded by an '=' all targets with ids                 
containing the filter string in any position will be listed.                    
                                                                                
  e.g.- a filter of ABC will pass all those with 'ABC' anywhere in the          
        id field.

Start the listing at this QSPEC.                                                
                                                                                
In the process of building a target definition you                              
can draw on Qspecs from many different areas of                                 
the file.

The Qspec is incorporated into the target                                       
definition with the given logical operator.  When                               
you have finished, return to the target display                                 
screen to check the results.                                                    
                                                                                
Most targets can probably be completely specified                               
this way, but more complicated ones may require                                 
some regrouping or parentheses.  In any case, it                                
should be easier to select Qspecs this way than to                              
type them in.

  You may include vehicles in your readership analysis reports even             
though they are not measured by the readership survey. Such vehicles            
are specifically identified on the report so that there can be no               
confusion about the source of the data.                                         
                                                                                
  There are two ways to specify the readership of non-measured                  
vehicles. One is by saying it is 'just like' a measured vehicle, but            
with a different circulation base. That is, it has the same audience            
composition, turnover rate, and duplication rate with other vehicles.           
This is usually called 'prototyping'.                                           
                                                                                
  The other method is to enter the required data directly (see next             
screen).

  This screen controls access to the survey data. Access can be                 
allowed for the whole file, only certain sections of the file, or not           
at all.                                                                         
                                                                                
  The surveys may be divided into access sections, each given a number          
between 1 and 255. Each card/column/punch is assigned an access code            
when the file is inverted.  The code is checked against the list of             
codes allowed or denied for the agency.
