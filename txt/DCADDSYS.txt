DCADDSYS          ADDING A NEW SYSTEM                          OCT06/88         
                  -------------------                                           
                                                                                
  This document is intended ultimately to be a complete guide to                
creating a new DDS system.                                                      
                                                                                
  At present it describes only the steps necessary to get an existing           
system to run under SPOOF.                                                      
                                                                                
RUNNING UNDER SPOOF                                                             
-------------------                                                             
                                                                                
   The following source books may require updating-                             
                                                                                
1) DDSPOOF                                                                      
                                                                                
  a) In the GO routine code must be included to ensure that a proper            
     parameter list is build for the application. Take care to use the          
     correct SYSFACS list (you may need a new one - see DDSPOOFC), and          
     to set the agency binary number from the right place.                      
                                                                                
  b) In GETSENUM set the proper values for you system. See under                
     CONFID for more about this.                                                
                                                                                
  c) You may have to add an entry for the system/program in CTYPLIST.           
     This list has in it the number of screen header fields necessary           
     for the root phase to figure out what overlay screen is needed.            
     REQTWA gets passed the value from the table and uses it to decide          
     how many screen fields to edit on its first (header) pass.                 
                                                                                
     If the program runs under GENCON you don't need to do anything             
     here, but if it runs under an older or a newer controller you              
     may. The value in the table is the number of fields (starting at           
     field 2) to be edited. See DDREQTWA.                                       
                                                                                
  d) At OPEN add a line for the system to turn off recovery.                    
                                                                                
  e) Add the system to the OPENADDS list and add a list of the                  
     system files.                                                              
                                                                                
2) DDSPOOFC                                                                     
                                                                                
  Here you may have to add a SYSFACS list for the system. The number            
of the list does not always correspond to the one in FATAB, but if              
possible it should.                                                             
                                                                                
  If the system uses FACRNDX to cause FACPAK to dynamically load                
certain phases, you can get SPOOF to do the same by putting the one             
byte phase number in the first byte of the address. See the MediaBase           
list for an example. If the system requires this be sure to do two              
things-                                                                         
                                                                                
    - End the list with an x'ff'                                                
    - Change the RESSYSF routine in DDSPOOF to handle the system.               
      This newly included routine now does only MediaBase.                      
                                                                                
3) DDREPMCON                                                                    
                                                                                
   Add an entry for the system at the end of VALLIST and include a              
SYSNNN tag to process the runtime system card. You have some choice             
regarding the format of this card.                                              
                                                                                
4) DMDMGR    (U.S. ONLY??)                                                      
                                                                                
   The FACSYTAB table must be updated to give the system a CTUSER               
file name suffix.                                                               
                                                                                
5) DDSPOOFACT                                                                   
                                                                                
   The should be re-assembled to ensure that the latest versions of             
things like FASYSLST are included.                                              
                                                                                
6) FAGETTXT                                                                     
                                                                                
   Update SYSLIST.                                                              
                                                                                
7) DDREQTWA                                                                     
                                                                                
   If you added an entry for the program in SPOOF's CTYPLIST, and the           
number of fields for REQTWA to edit on the header pass is anything              
other than 2, 4, or 5 you will have to make minor and obvious changes           
to the OUT routine, between OUT8 and OUT10. The code is a bit                   
mysterious, but it seems to work.                                               
                                                                                
  Also, there is a list of system codes called SYSTWO, but its use is           
not clear. It has something to do with SPOOK which in turn has                  
something to do with soon reporting.                                            
                                                                                
8) DDCONFID2 and DDCNTRL2                                                       
                                                                                
    Add the system to SYSINDX in DDCONFID2 and to DDCNTRL2, the                 
CONFID dsect.
