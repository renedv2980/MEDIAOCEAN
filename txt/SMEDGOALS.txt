You enter campaign objectives, or "goals" for each product in the Goals        
Program.  Goal input is optional.  If entered, goal data can serve two         
purposes: Media plans provide recaps of weekly goals and serve as a buying     
guide; and goal data provides a standard for evaluating the efficiency of TV   
and radio campaigns after schedules have been aired.

Goals expressed as weekly target CPP or CPM achievement and expected dollar    
expenditures, are normally entered for each market and daypart.  They may be   
entered for the entire campaign or on a week-by-week basis to accomodate target
variances within different periods of a campaign.

In the procedure described above, the CPP guides are set up on separate CPP    
estimates.  It is also possible to set up guides directly on the pool estimate 
in a pool campaign.  This option can simplify input, but does not permit use of
CPP for non-pool campaigns or multiple target demos.
