         TITLE 'REFUSE  - Recovery File Search'                                 
Program reads any recovery disk/tape and filters according to input parameters  
given in control cards.                                                         
                                                                                
The file to be read must be specified in a //recvin dd statement.               
Output will either be directed to a dataset specified in a //recvout dd         
statement, printed, or both.                                                    
                                                                                
Note: REFUSE gets file information from DMFILTAB. If you see strange or         
      incomplete results when peeling records from a particular file, make sure 
      that the file has an accurate entry in DMFILTAB.

OUTPUT=<DISK,PRINT,BOTH>          DISK writes recovery records to recvout       
                                  dataset and also prints input parameters      
                                  and totals of records read and written.

                                  records written.  Also, the recovery          
                                  header is partially translated for bimbos.
