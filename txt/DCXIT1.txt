         TITLE 'XIT1'                                                           
Macro is used at the end of subroutine to restore caller's registers and to     
return to caller via RE.                                                        
                                                                                
(Name)   XIT1                Will restore all caller's registers                
                                                                                
(Name)   XIT1  REGS=(Rn)     Will restore all except Rn.                        
                             This allows a value to be passed back              
                             in a register.                                     
                                                                                
(Name)   XIT1  REGS=(Rn,Rm)  Will restore all except Rn-Rm.                     
                             (These must be in saved order RE-RC.)              
                                                                                
Note that the condition code is unaffected by XIT1 which allows caller to       
conditionally branch as a result of code set in sub-routine.
