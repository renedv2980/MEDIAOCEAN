Input for the EXCEPTIONS ONLY? field now has been combined with the FLAG       
PERCENTAGE field of the D8 request screen in order to make room for additional 
options fields. The EXCEPTIONS ONLY? field has been removed from the Request   
Screen on the Sweep Report (D8).  

To report exception only demos with your own flag percentage, preceed          
percentage input in the FLAG PERCENTAGE field with 'E'.
