The SMTP module enables an offline program to create e-mails to be sent         
to DDS personel using the JES SMTP (Simple Mail Transport protocol)             
facility.  Any number of e-mails may be sent in one execution.  The             
module attaches the generalized JESMAIL program to interface to SMTP            
when it is called with the initialization action (SMTPAINI) and detached        
when called with the end action (SMTPAEND) - it is important that the           
end action is used as it will cause an abend in the main program if not.        
                                                                                
To initialize the JESMAIL facility use the following:-                          
                                                                                
         GOTOR VSMTP,DMCB,('SMTPAINI',0)                                        
                                                                                
The name of the JESMAIL phase may be overridden by the calling                  
program (used for testing new versions of JESMAIL that may come along)          
as follows:-

JESPHASE DC    C'JESMAILA'                                                      
                                                                                
Once JESMAIL is attached one or more e-mails can be sent.  Each e-mail          
consists of a recipent list, optional subject matter text and one or            
more lines of body text.  The recipient list is a list of DDS nicknames         
or people, list entries are delimited by a comma and terminated by a            
a space or colon.                                                               
                                                                                
The following are examples of valid recipient lists:-                           
                                                                                
RECEIPT1 DC    C'JNEW,AATK '                                                    
RECEIPT2 DC    C'JNEW,AATK:'                                                    
RECEIPT3 DC    C'John.Newnham,Alan.Atkinson:'                                   
                                                                                
Both the recipient list and subject matter are defined by the SMTPAPRS          
action.  To send an e-mail with subject matter defined use:-                    
                                                                                
         GOTOR VSMTP,DMCB,('SMTPAPRS',RECEIPT1),(L'SUBJECT,SUBJECT)             
                                                                                
SUBJECT  DC    C'This is the subject of my e-mail'                              
                                                                                
To send an e-mail with no subject use:-                                         
                                                                                
         GOTOR VSMTP,DMCB,('SMTPAPRS',RECEIPT1),0                               
                                                                                
Lines of body text are sent one at a time.  Each text line is assumed to        
be a space filled 80 character string.  Example:-                               
                                                                                
         GOTOR VSMTP,DMCB,('SMTPAPTL',TEXT1)                                    
         GOTOR VSMTP,DMCB,('SMTPAPTL',TEXT2)                                    
                                                                                
TEXT1    DC    CL80'This is line one of the body text'                          
TEXT2    DC    CL80'This is line two of the body text'                          
                                                                                
Once the recipent, subject and any text lines have been processed the           
e-mail can be sent to JESMAIL for processing as follows:-                       
                                                                                
         GOTOR VSMTP,DMCB,('SMTPASND',0)                                        
                                                                                
The e-mails are created withing a buffer defined in SMTP itself - the           
total number of lines for the complete SMTP message cannot exceed the           
size of the buffer (currently 200 text lines long).  There is a small           
amount of system overhead so limit the e-mail to 190-(#Recipients*2)            
lines.  SMTP will die if the text buffer overflows.                             
                                                                                
Before exiting back to MVS call SMTP to detach the JESMAIL facility as          
follows:-                                                                       
                                                                                
         GOTOR VSMTP,DMCB,('SMTPAEND',0)
