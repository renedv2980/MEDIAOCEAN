NEW REPORT ALLOWS AUTOMATIC ENTRY OF NTI NUMBERS

You can now add NTI program numbers to your buy files automatically.  Instead of
                                                                               
entering NTI numbers manually for each program, you can now run a Seed Report to

into any units which don't already have numbers entered.

The new report also checks any NTI numbers already entered in your buy files.  
It automatically compares NTI numbers previously entered into buys with the    
numbers which appear in the pocket piece.  The program names and numbers are   
reported from both the buy files and the pocket piece.  Any discrepancies are  
flagged making it easy for you to update your records.

you can run a Seed Report after each pocket piece is loaded to fill in any NTI 
numbers which you didn't enter earlier.  You can also skip manual entry of NTI 
numbers altogether and just run Seed Reports regularly to enter NTI program    
numbers.

Normally, if more than one NTI number is reported for a program in the pocket  
piece, the Seed Report will automatically seed the first one.  You can override
this with the 'NOMULT' option which lets you report both numbers without seeding

The NETPAK Seed Report also has a test feature which allows you to see the     
results of a Seed Report prior to execution.  This provides added flexibility  
and safety as it lets you see what would be entered and reported without       
actually making any changes in your files.
