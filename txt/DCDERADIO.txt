  Arb produces a quarterly book four times a year. A comprehensive national     
sweep is conducted in the spring which includes all of the defined radio markets
in the U.S. A more limited, but extensive sweep is done in the fall of the year 
and two small sweeps are done in the spring and the summer in the bigger        
markets.  The number of markets covered by each of these sweeps is:             
                                                                                
              Spring Survey - 260 markets                                       
              Fall   Survey - 123 markets                                       
              Winter Survey -  23 markets                                       
              Summer Survey -  12 markets                                       
                                                                                
  Birch produces a quarterly report four times a year for 212 markets and a     
monthly report for 89 markets 12 times a year. In addition to this data Birch   
also does a qualitative report for the monthly markets 2 times a year. The      
qualitative data changes from report to report so some qualitative catagories   
appear only once a year.                                                        
                                                                                
  The quarterly book is the only place where Birch and ARB have comparable data.
While the formats of the books are different and some reported catagories and   
dayparts are different the tape formats are identical for the quarterly sweeps. 
There are however two areas in which the data are different. Arb reports data   
based on MSA,TSA, and ADI market areas while Birch reports only MSA data. Arb   
reports all time periods while Birch does not report any 12m-6am data. Arb      
provides hour by hour data for the weekend dayparts. Birch does not.            
                                                                                
  While there are some exceptions it can generally be said that if we have a    
quarterly or a monthly book for a market we can calculate ratings,shares,       
impressions, pur(people using radio), cume(reach) ,and universe figures on an   
hour/by/hour and/or a daypart basis for all age/sex permutations which are      
derivable from the core cells given by the rating services.  By definition no   
ratings,shares,universes, or purs are available in the TSA.                     
                                                                                
  The qualitative data is similar to NAD data in the sense that it is three     
dimensional. We have a classification broken down into a catagory broken down   
into age/sex demographics.                                                      
                                                                                
  Some areas such as the availabiltity of combined station data require         
further reseach. Other than that this document should serve as a guide          
to what is available.
