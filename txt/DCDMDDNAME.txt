         TITLE 'DMDDNAME                                                        
This module is included in DMDDSIO and can be called with =V(DMDDNAME)          
from any offline program that includes DMDMGRL. DMDDNAME can be called          
with a 7/8 chr file name (e.g ACCDIR1), a 1/2 chr system name (e.g S=A1)        
or a 4/5 chr system name (e.g SYS=ACC1). The syntax S=... and SYS=.....         
is to indicate that you are passing a short or a long system name rather        
that a file name. It can also be called with a SE number in binary with         
the syntax SE=0X where 0 is binary zero and X is binary SE number which         
can usually be found at UTL+4(1).                                               
                                                                                
The routine searches the various tables of files and/or systems that are        
part of data manager looking for a match on the file name or system             
name. If a match is found an info block of relevent data is passed back.        
This is defined by the PAN book DMDDNAMED shown below. The most relevent        
piece of data is usually the SE Number which is defined by DDNASENO.            
DANASENO is at +1(1) in the return area.                                        
                                                                                
Param1+0(1) X'22'=locate request file X'24'=locate recovery file                
Param1+1(3) A(=C'DMDDNAME') data manager command                                
                                                                                
Param2+0(1) X'80'=get allocated DSN using DYNALLOC                              
Param2+1(3) A(CL8 file name) or A(system name) See below for format             
                                                                                
Param3+0(1) Return X'10' if file or system not found                            
Param3+1(3) Return A(Control block defined by DMDDNAMED)                        
                                                                                
Param2 contains either the address of an 8-byte area containing a file          
name or it contains the address of an area with the format S=sab or             
SYS=sssab. The format S=sab means you are passing a short system name           
where the first chr "s" is the system letter and "ab" is the one or two         
chr system letter/number. e.g. S=A1 or S=AIT. The format SYS=sssab means        
you are passing a three chr system name followed by a two chr system            
letter or number. e.g. SYS=ACC1 or SYS=ACCIT. Also supported is a call          
to pass the binary SE number where the first three chrs of the 8-byte           
area are C'SE=', the next byte is set to binary zero, and the fifth             
byte is set to the binary SE number.                                            
                                                                                
Note that a two chr repesentation of the system is standard. If you are         
only using a one chr system letter or number the second chr must be a           
set to a space.                                                                 
                                                                                
If a system name is passed the first file name defined in that system is        
returned in DDNADDN unless X'22' is passed in p1(1) in which case the           
name of the request file is returned or if X'24' is set in p1(1) then           
the name of the recovery file is returned in DDNADDN.                           
                                                                                
If a file name is passed the DDS dynamic allocation table is searched           
and the standard DSN is returned. So if ACCFIL1 was passed, the DSN that        
is returned is ACC.ACCFIL1. However, if X'80' is set in Param2+0 the            
DYNALLOC macro is executed on the DDNAME. If a DD statement is present,         
or the file has been opened dynamically, the actual DSN will be returned        
in the field DDNADSN and DDNADSNF will be set to X'80'.                         
                                                                                
Sample Code

The code sample below shows a card containing the system name and the           
call to DMDDNAME to validate and extract the SE number. We assume that          
an input card contining S=Sab or SYS=SSSab is input. If the program             
has another syntax like SYSTEM=Sab then the value in SYSNAME must be            
adjusted to match the call syntax of DMDDNAME.
