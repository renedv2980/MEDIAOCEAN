<CHAP>DDS PROFS Mail System                                                     
The DDS PROFS System is an electronic mail system which provides you with the   
means to communicate with other PROFS users through your DDS terminal.  The     
PROFS System allows you to:                                                     
                                                                                
  >Receive Notes from other PROFS users.                                        
  >File Notes in 'Note Logs' for future reference.                              
  >Send Notes to other PROFS users.                                             
  >Save copies of your own notes and resend them.                               
  >Reply to notes from other people.                                            
  >Manage your Note Logs.                                                       
  >Set day/time reminders.                                                      
                                                                                
All the tasks in PROFS are performed through various menu screens. Each menu    
screen lists the available options, which may be performed by pressing          
function (PF) keys.  As you move through the system, each task will be listed   
beside its PF key number, either on the left-hand side or along the bottom of   
the screens.  The PF keys can be used to perform actions, such as sending or    
forwarding notes, as well as moving you forward to the next screen or back      
to the previous menu.                                                           
                                                                                
In each case the options available for a screen are listed on that screen.      
In most cases the meaning for each option is self-explanatory.  However,        
each screen also has a 'help' option, which displays a page (or several pages)  
of additional information about that screen.  The 'help' screen is accessed     
by pressing PF9.                                                                
                                                                                
After you have performed your desired action (or actions), you will have to     
return to previous menu screens, either to choose a different action, or to     
exit PROFS.  In most cases, the PF12 key will return you to the previous menu   
screen.                                                                         
                                                                                
The messages 'RUNNING' and 'SYSTEM' in the lower right-hand corner of the       
screen indicate that your PROFS request is processing -- you must wait.         
However, the message 'MORE...' in the lower right-hand corner of the            
screen indicates that you must press CLEAR (or ALT+CLEAR) to return to PROFS.

note if you are forwarding it), you can forward, reply to, or resend the note   
through a procedure similar to the procedure for sending notes (see: 'Sending   
a Note' below).                                                                 
                                                                                
After you have forwarded, replied to, or re-sent a note, you will receive       
confirmation on the upper left-hand corner of the screen.                       
                                                                                
You may use Special Note commands when you are forwarding, replying to, or      
resending a note.  See Special Note Commands, below.                            
                                                                                
You may also forward, reply to or resend a note that has been stored in a       
note log.  See Managing Specific Note Logs, below).

All notes that you send, forward, reply to, or resend will automatically be     
filed in your 'NOTE' Log (unless you enter a command to prevent this -- see     
Special Note Commands, below).  In addition, any notes that you receive and     
file by pressing the PF2 key will also be filed in the NOTE log.                
                                                                                
You can set up and name your own Note Logs.  To do this, type in the name you   
have chosen for your log over the word 'NOTES'.  When you press the PF2 key,    
the system will automatically set up that note log. You may designate as many   
note logs as you wish.  When you file a note in an existing log, the note is    
added to the log.  When you type in the name of a log that doesn't exist, the   
system sets up a new log using that name.                                       
                                                                                
To store a note in a special note log, type the name of that note log over the  
word 'NOTE', and press the PF2 key.

Press PF6                       To format your note.  The system will remove    
                                unnecessary space from your text and put        
                                words that were split by the page end back      
                                together.

  If you enter any Special Note Commands (see Special Note Commands, below) and 
  press PF6, these commands will seem to disappear from the bottom of the text. 
  They will, however, still be recognized by the system.

Note Commands provide you with additional options when you are sending          
notes.  To use Note Commands, enter the Command code, followed by a space and   
the additional information on a line below the text of your note.  The          
Note Command codes and actions are outlined below:                              
                                                                                
 .CC             To have your note sent to additional PROFS users as "cc"       
                 copies.  Follow this code with the user names of the           
                 additional users.                                              
                 (e.g., .CC KHANDDNY).                                          
                                                                                
 .AD             To add space to the SEND TO line.  Type this code at the       
                 beginning of a blank line, then follow the code with the user  
                 names of the additional users.                                 
                 (e.g., .AD KHANDDNY).                                          
                                                                                
 .LF             To have your note filed in a log of your choice.               
                 Follow this code with the name of the log.                     
                 (e.g., .LF MYLOG)                                              
                                                                                
 .NL             To keep your note from being stored in the NOTE log.  If you   
                 do not enter .LF or .NL commands, your note will               
                 automatically be stored in the NOTE log.                       
                                                                                
 .AT             To substitute a name for user name on the SEND TO line.        
                 Follow this code with the substitute name.                     
                 (e.g., .AT ALL ACCOUNT SUPERVISORS)                            
                                                                                
 .CT             To substitute a title for a group of user names on the .CC     
                 line (e.g., All Account Supervisers).  Follow this code with   
                 the title.  This command is useful if you are sending the      
                 note to a large group of users.
