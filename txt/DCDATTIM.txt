         TITLE 'DATTIM'                                                         
Provide or converts a 4 byte DDS date time field. The DDS date time             
field is a full word that represents the number of seconds from zero            
hundred hours on 1st January 1992. This gives a time span of about              
60 years which gives a date/time range from 1992 thru 2062.

               bytes 1-3     A(14 byte ebcdid date/time YYYYMMDDHHMMSS)         
                                                                                
                                                                                
Note that if X'80' bit on in P1 then caller must pass the date/time data        
in P1 (X'81') or in P2 (X'82').                                                 
                                                                                
Normal call will be to get the date/time field and to return it in a 4          
byte area (in this example FULL).                                               
                                                                                
          GOTO1 =V(DATTIM),DMCB,(X'01',FULL)                                    
          BNE   CANTDOIT                                                        
                                                                                
Note that the condition code is set to nonzero if an error occurred. In         
the above example the only possible return code in 4(R1) is 1 which             
means that MVS was unable to return the date/time.                              
                                                                                
Conversion call will typically convert a DDS date/time field to a               
14 byte EBCDIC format C'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' for printing.                           
                                                                                
          GOTO1 =V(DATTIM),DMCB,(X'81',FULL),WORK                               
          BNE   CANTDOIT                                                        
                                                                                
If FULL was binary zeros the answer in WORK would be C'19920101000000'.         
A non zero return code would meen that an invatid DDS date had been             
passed or that the caller's parameter list was invalid.
