This program is used by STXITER to print dumps and should only be called        
directly when a user program wishes to continue processing after a program      
check.                                                                          
                                                                                
Linkage must be established by BALR 14,15. No register save area from calling   
program is necessary.                                                           
                                                                                
Module has no EXTRN.
