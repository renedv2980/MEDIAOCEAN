 Examples                                                                       
 --------                                                                       
                                                                                
To delete elements with a code of X'FF' from a record.                          
GOTO1=V(HELLO),DMCB,(C'D',account),(X'FF',ACREC),0,0                            
                                                                                
To delete elements with a code of X'32' and data of C'123456' from a record.    
GOTO1 =V(HELLO),DMCB,(C'D',account),(X'32',ACREC),=C'123456',0                  
                                                                                
To add an element to a record in sorted order.                                  
GOTO1 =V(HELLO),DMCB,(C'P',account),ACREC,ADDEL,0                               
                                                                                
To add an element to the end of a record.                                       
GOTO1 =V(HELLO),DMCB,(C'P',account),ACREC,ADDEL,=C'ADD=END'                     
                                                                                
Note - with the new version of HELLO (Oct/00) the record will not be            
allowed to be made bigger than the maximum record size.                         
                                                                                
If you want to do this deliberately, we recommend the use of the file           
'CORETAB'. This is an entry, with a zero length key (imagine a DDS              
record comprised of key/length/elements, but without the key).                  
This has a max length of x'FFFF', and should be sufficient for most             
needs.                                                                          
                                                                                
Note that HELLO may be called with lowercase action characters. These           
actions are identical to their uppercase counterparts, but they                 
require a maximum record length override value to be passed in P5.
