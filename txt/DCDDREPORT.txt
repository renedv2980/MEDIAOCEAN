A) Introduction                                                                 
---------------                                                                 
                                                                                
     DDREPORT is an offline utility program with which sorted and               
filtered reports can be produced from the data dictionary source files.         
A data dictionary pan book name which contains 'TERM' entries and               
optionally a book name containing 'NOTE' entries should be specified.           
Entries, grouped by equate number, are sorted alphabetically for a given        
language. A sort key text string is extracted from either the longest           
or the shortest string in the entry. The output is filtered to match            
both the given list of language types and any search string specified.          
The report is produced on the standard output.                                  
                                                                                
     In addition a Data Dictionary pan book name which contains Equate          
name assignments can be specified. If so the report extracts and prints         
the equate name in the heading for each equate number entry group.              
                                                                                
     The program is run by submitting JCL catalogued procedure DDREP            
and run options are controlled by the following card data input lines.
