Validates a day expression.

Parameter 2              A(one-byte day field)                                  
                         If zero, the expression is invalid                     
                         Otherwise bits are set for each day -

 Valid Expressions                                                              
 -----------------                                                              
                                                                                
Days can be from 1-3 byte format (example M MO MON are valid) but T and S are   
invalid as these are ambiguous.                                                 
Days can be separated by commas/slashes indicating a list of days.              
Days can be separated by dashes which indicates a range of days.                
Thus M,W or M/W = Mon,Wed, while M-W = Mon,Tue,Wed.                             
Expressions can be combined together and may wrap around (W-F,SU,M).            
Special compressed 7-character format (example N.WT.SS)
