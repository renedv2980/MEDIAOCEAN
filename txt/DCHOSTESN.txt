   JOBNAME - is MVS job name of the started task                                
      e.g. HOSTESN1 - Job started to access 'live' FACPAK system files          
      or   HOSTESNT - Job started to access 'test' FACPAK system files

      If Main task doing common processing same as JOBNAME.                     
      else name of ESS 'Sender' or 'Receiver' session                           
      e.g. ESS00001 - I.e ESS #00001 Sender session.                            
      or   ESR00001 - I.e ESS #00001 Receiver session.

   'HOSTESS UNIQUE JOB NAME TEST OK'                                            
       When the HOSTESN program is first started it does a test                 
       to check that no other job is running on MVS with that same job          
       name. This is to prevent it running before previously                    
       executing instances of HOSTESN have been stopped or cancelled.           
       It does this by Dynamically Allocating a temporary MVS                   
       Data Set with the job name as part of the Data set name.                 
       HOSTESN1 - attempts to allocate 'ESS.TST.HOSTESN1'                       
       HOSTESNT - attempts to allocate 'ESS.TST.HOSTESNT'                       
       If these data sets are already open the job fails with                   
       error message:

       This message is sent durring initialisation of HOSTESN and               
       indicates that a Session Control block has been allocated to             
       handle communications with the specified ESS Sender or Receiver.         
       The ESS Sender or Receiver name and Independent LU are shown.            
       Session Control blocks are built on the basis of information             
       contained in the ESSid Control records in CON/ESS.

       This messages is sent when initialisation of HOSTESN has                 
       been completed. This includes the porcess of initialisation
