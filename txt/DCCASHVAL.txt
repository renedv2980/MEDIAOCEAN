Validates a variable length field for numeric or cash field.                    
                                                                                
Parameter 1    byte  0       Number of decimal places - max 5.                  
                             The default will be 2, unless a EURO               
                             conversion is taking place. In this case,          
                             the default will be set by CASHVAL,                
                             according to the input currency.                   
                                                                                
                             If x'80' bit is on output will be returned         
                             in parameters 2 and 3 as an 8 byte packed          
                             field. Integer values should be coded with         
                             C'N' for binary output, C'0' (zero) for PL8        
                             output.

The input currency can be taken as either the primary or secondary              
currency code. This will depend on the currency prefix in the input             
field. If no prefix is passed,the input currency will defualt to that           
passed in P3/B1-3.                                                              
                                                                                
If bit X'40' is not on :-                                                       
The input currency code is used in validating currency codes & symbols.         
This can be any valid currency code.                                            
If no input currency code is passed in P3, the default will be the              
country currency code/symbol. eg DEM/DM for Germany.

Binary output:                                                                  
P2 contains full-word signed cash value binary for primary currency.            
P3 contains full-word signed cash value for secondary currency.                 
Returning a binary diffrence:-                                                  
If P2/B0 X'1C' bits are on, diffrence will be returned in P2.                   
Otherwise, difference will be returned in P3.

P2/P3 contains double-word signed cash value for primary currency.              
P4/P5 contains double-word signed cash value for secondary currency.            
Returning a packed diffrence:-                                                  
If P2/B0 X'1C' bits are on, diffrence will be returned in P2/P3.                
Otherwise, difference will be returned in P4/P5.
