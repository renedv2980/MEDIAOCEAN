         TITLE 'DMERASE'                                                        
                                                                                
DMERASE is used to erase a DDS file. An erase action removes all records        
by clearing each track. Daily files such as request files and recovery          
files are erased once in each 24 hour production cycle.                         
                                                                                
The SYSIN input to DMERASE has optional parameter cards plus one card           
per file that needs to be erased.The data on a file card is simply the          
file name in Cols 1-8. The file name is then checked against all known          
DDS files and if the file is defined as a local file, or is a file that         
is not part of an application system, then the erase is performed.              
                                                                                
If the file is a global file whose current status is defined in a               
dataspace then further checks are made before the erase is done.                
Record zero of the file is read and the CPU id and the dataspace id is          
extracted. All global files must be stamped with a cpu id and a                 
dataspace id (see DCSTAMPER).                                                   
                                                                                
DMERASE must be run in the same CPU as the one where the file(s) are            
currently stamped. If a file is stamped as being owned by SY1 then              
DMERASE must be run in SY1.                                                     
                                                                                
DMERASE then attaches to the dataspace defined by record zero (A for            
ADV, T for TST, and R for REP). All global files in one DMERASE EXEC            
must belong to the same dataspace Eg TST and ADV files cant be erased           
in the same EXEC.                                                               
                                                                                
If the system to which the file belongs is inactive then DMERASE locks          
the system with a maintenance status, erases the file, and frees the            
system. This means that no system can be active when one of its files           
is being erased, and also that no other job can open the system whilst          
on erase of one of its files is taking place.                                   
                                                                                
If the system to which the file belongs is open, a message is put to the        
operator's console asking for action. The standard action should be to          
fix the problem (ie stop the system if it is still up) and to type              
RETRY to the messagem. If the problem can not be fixed then the reply           
of CANCEL will cancel the DMERASE step and the current file plus those          
named after it in the SYSIN deck will not be erased.                            
                                                                                
The name of a job that has the system open will be displayed on the             
console plus the count, if any, of other jobs that also have the system         
open. See the example below for details of the console messages.                
                                                                                
DMERASE takes its input from SYSIN or the operators console. This option        
is defined by the PARM=... param on the EXEC card. Other options can            
also be defined by this PARM= or can be input. The PARM= allows up to           
eight options to be entered. All erase OK messages, error messages, are         
displayed on the operator console, along with messages that require             
operator intervention.                                                          
                                                                                
PARM=11.. is the usual value for the first two options. This means that         
input is read from SYSIN and that operator verification of each erase is        
NOT required. If the second option is set to zero then a message                
XXXXXXXX IS ABOUT TO BE ERASED - VERIFY                                         
is output on the console for each file and the operator has to reply -          
ERASE for the erase to continue                                                 
IGNORE to skip the erase and go on to the next file

UPSI=........  To set flags as defined by PARM=....... on EXEC card             
WRITE=N        Do not write to files. No erase takes place. Testing use.        
FORCE=Y        Forces an override to the rules of stamping                      
GLOBAL=N       Sets each subsequent file to local and doesnt check dspid

Sample JCL and SYSIN as follows to erase PER1 files. In this example the        
PER1 files were stamped as test files and DMERASE checked out the status        
of the PER1 test system. It was found to be still open in FACTST job and        
a message was sent to the console asked for action. The operator typed          
in "RETRY" after he took down the PER1 system in FACTST and then the            
erase of PERREQ1 and PERRCV1 then completed sucessfully.
