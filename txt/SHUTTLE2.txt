The Shuttle Series/1 and Series/2 printing systems allow your office to receive
and store reports from DDS, usually overnight, and print them at your own      
convenience, in any order or quantity.

The system includes a computer with a disk storage unit, a modem, a video      
display terminal (VDT), and either one or two printers.  The system is         
connected by dedicated (permanent) phone line to the DDS computer center in New
York.  This can be the same line that is used for other DDS terminals, or it   
can be a separate line.

The system receives reports, stores them on your disk, and allows you to print 
them.  You can select any of the stored reports for printing, control the      
printing sequence, and start or stop the printer at any page.

2.Have room on your storage disk for the reports.  There should always be   
enough room on your disk for all of a day's reports.  However, if you         
decide to save reports from previous days, you must be alert to the           
possibility that you might run out of storage space.  The system will tell    
you how much storage space is left as reports are being received.  If there   
is not enough room for your reports, you must tell the system to PURGE some   
reports.

         HEAD0 'System Status Heading Line'                                     
All screens (except the ONLINE monitor screen) have the same heading line.  In 
the center, you will see 'DDS SHUTTLE REPORT PRINTING SYSTEM'.                 
         SPACE 2                                                                
At the left-hand side, your system name is displayed (e.g., S1HD), or, if the  
system is in ONLINE mode, the ONLINE status is displayed.  If the system is in 
ONLINE mode and no errors are detected, the word ONLINE is shown in reverse    
color.  If there is a fault on the line or the disk file is full, the ONLINE   
status is shown highlighted.

At the right-hand side, a single printer system shows today's date, unless     
the printer is running (in which case PRINTING is shown in reverse color) or is
stopped (STOPPED is shown highlighted).  Twin printer systems always show the  
status of the two printers, P1 and P2.  Each name is shown in reverse color,   
dimmed if the printer is available, on full if the printer is running and      
highlighted if the printer is stopped.                                         
         HEAD0 'Printing on Twin Printer Systems'                               
As described above, the system status heading line is different for single     
printer and twin printer systems.  In addition, printer commands (SCHEDULE,    
START, STOP, RESTART, FLUSH, KILL, ALTER, and STATUS) usually require that you 
specify the printer name (P1 or P2), on the input line following the command.  
         SPACE 2                                                                
If the program detects that only one of the two printers is valid, it will     
automatically display the required printer name and continue.  For instance, if
P1 is printing and P2 has been stopped, the command RESTART will automatically 
select printer P2; you will only be asked to input the restart page number.    
         SPACE 2                                                                
PDISPLAYs and Error Logs are always printed on the designated system printer.  
This is normally P1.  If, however, you wish to use P2, there is a command      
CONFIG which enables you to switch system printers.  Its use is self-          
explanatory if you should need it.

If the system fails for any reason and your terminal will not respond to       
pressing of the ENTER key or function keys, you can restart it by pressing the 
RESET button on the processor (on the Series/2) or the blue LOAD button (on the
Series/1).  The system will automatically restart and reset the terminal       
screen.  (If nothing appears on the screen within a minute of resetting the    
system, you probably have a hardware failure and should contact DDS.)

Restarting does not affect the status of any reports that have been stored on  
your disk.  If you are receiving a report when you press RESET/LOAD, however,  
you can lose one block of data.  If this happens, you must arrange to have the 
report retransmitted.
