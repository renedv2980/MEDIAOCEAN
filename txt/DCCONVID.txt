         TITLE 'CONVID3: CTFILE USER ID CLEARANCE PROGRAM'                      
                                                                                
   The program is an external module which can be run alone in a                
reporting mode or as the dump step of a standard dump and load                  
sequence on the Control file.                                                   
   It is assumed that a list of valid Agency Alpha IDs has been built           
in file DDS.AGENCY.ACCESS, ( by program CONVID1.)                               
   The program runs through four steps as follows.                              
                                                                                
1) The file of Agency Alpha IDs is read and a list of valid IDs is              
   built.                                                                       
2) Updates list of valid IDs from latest state of control file                  
   agency alpha id records.                                                     
3) The Control file User ID records are read. These are validated               
   against the list of Agency Alpha IDs and a list of valid User IDs            
   is built. (Reference to both Alpha and Numeric code.)                        
4) All records in the Control File are read and those associated with           
   User IDs are processed against the valid User ID list.                       
   The records affected and rules of processing are as follows.
