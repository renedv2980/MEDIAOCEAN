         TITLE 'DDGEN - DATA DICTIONARY GENERATION UTILITY -- July 1993'        
                                                                                
                                                                                
A) Introduction                                                                 
---------------                                                                 
                                                                                
     DDGEN is an offline utility program which generates Data Dictionary        
load phases on DDS.LOADLIB.  It reads the Data Dictionary records in            
GENDIR/GENFIL for a specified system and language(s) and creates an             
object module that serves as input to the link-edit step.  The load             
phase(s) produced by the link-edit are named in a standard form for the         
particular system and language.                                                 
                                                                                
     The program is run by submitting JCL catalogued procedure DDGEN            
and run options are controlled by the following card data input lines.          
                                                                                
B) JCL CARD DATA INPUT.                                                         
-----------------------

1)   SYSTEM=<Name of FACPAK system (See FASYSLST, long or short name)>          
         e.g.  SYSTEM=MED   (The Media system.)                                 
                                                                                
2)   LANG=<List of languages for generation>

1)   LINK=<Y> Produce link edited output phase for each language.               
         Default no.

         Append output Load phase name with 'test' character.                   
         Default character is 'A' in the US, and ' ' in UK.                     
     Note: Without the TEST= card in the UK, live versions of load              
            phases will be produced and existing load modules with the          
            same phase name will be overwritten.

C) OUTPUT.                                                                      
----------                                                                      
                                                                                
1)   Listing generated on standard printer output file, e.g.                    
     accesible by 'flasher' in TSO. Listing includes generation                 
     report for each language pass, any additional information as               
     requested by control input,(see (B) above,) and report of any              
     Link Edit steps that occurred.                                             
                                                                                
2)   Load phase for each succesful generation of a dictionary , if              
     requested by control input.                                                
     Phase name of format:                                                      
         <T00DSL>, where S=System number and L=Language code.                   
         e.g.    T00D43   is the Media system German data dictionary            
                          load phase.                                           
     Also a test character may be appended to the name (see (B) above.)         
                                                                                
D) Data Dictionary Syntax Rules.                                                
--------------------------------                                                
                                                                                
     Data Dictionary text kept in GENDIR/GENFIL records follow a special        
     format when being maintained by CTL/GEN.  There are two lines              
     available for text input, the first of which must be used.                 
                                                                                
     Format of Term entry line is as follows:                                   
                                                                                
       <Start delimiter><List{<String><Delimiter>}>                             
                                                                                
     Where:                                                                     
                                                                                
<Start delimiter> : a 1 character symbol start indicator                        
     either  '>' standard start of entry string list (1st & 2nd line)           
     or      '<' denotes a direct continuation of first line (2nd line only)    
<List{<String><Delimiter>}> : list in ascending length order of                 
     {<string><Delimiter>}                                                      
<String> : Data dictionary entry text.                                          
     Must be at least 1 character                                               
     Must be at least 1 string in list                                          
     String can be in 'SEPARATED' format e.g. :                                 
     '>  First half:  Second half>'                                             
     where ':' is separator character. First half text must be                  
     same length as second half text.                                           
     To use the characters '>' and ':' to mean themselves, enter                
     '>>' and '::' respectively (e.g. >hh::mm::ss> will show up as              
     hh:mm:ss on reports)                                                       
<Delimiter> : 1 character symbol '>' indicates end of string                    
     It is not necessary for the last string on the first line if and           
     only if that string is continued onto the second line, in which            
     case, the second line must begin with the '<' start delimiter              
     and end with the '>' following the last string.                            
                                                                                
E) Notes.                                                                       
---------                                                                       
                                                                                
1)   It used to be that the Data Dictionaries in DDS.LOADLIB were               
     $LOADed into FACPAK so that online applications may use them as            
     well.  Now that the Data Dictionaries are built into FACPAK from           
     scratch every morning, the load phases produced by DDGEN are               
     used primarily by offline application programs.
