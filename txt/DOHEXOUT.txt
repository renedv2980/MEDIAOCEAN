DDHEXOUT - Module to output hex version of string                               
-------------------------------------------------                               
Converts a string of 4-bit hexadecimal characters to 8-bit hexadecimal          
characters (EBCDIC)                                                             
                                                                                
Param1   A(source)                                                              
Param2   A(destination)                                                         
Param3   L'source                                                               
Param4   A(format) - C'SEP'- or XL1 Lite flag (see below)                       
Param5   Return L'destination or zero if invalid. Standard version only         
                                                                                
Standard Version                                                                
----------------                                                                
If bit 32 (left most) bit of either Param1 or Param2 is on then the             
A(source) and A(destination) addresses will both be treated as 31-bit           
addresses.                                                                      
                                                                                
Formats                                                                         
-------                                                                         
The normal output alternates between zone and digit nibbles (zdzdzdzd)          
Normal is assumed if Param4 is zero or points to any string who's               
value is not =C'SEP'. This format is called MIXED and it is valid to            
code =C'MIX' in Param4 to indicate this. Also common is to use =C'TOG'          
to mean "Together" as zone and digit are together in output.                    
                                                                                
If Param4 points to the character constant =C'SEP', then output will            
separate all the zones from all the digits (zzzzdddd). This format is           
useful if printing the hex output as two lines lining up with the text.         
                                                                                
Lite version                                                                    
------------                                                                    
There are two entry points to access the efficient version of the code          
known as the LITE version.The lite version only supports the standard           
MIXED output and does not return the l'destination in Param5.                   
                                                                                
24-bit lite - If source and destination are 24-bit addresses then the           
entry point V(HEXO24) can be used. Control can also be passed to the            
24-bit lite version by using V(HEXOUT) and setting high order byte of           
Param4 to 24.                                                                   
                                                                                
31-bit lite - If source and destination are 31-bit addresses then the           
entry point V(HEXO31) can be used. Control can also be passed to the            
31-bit lite version by using V(HEXOUT) and setting high order byte of           
Param4 to 31. This does not need, or support, the convention of setting         
on the X'80' bit in Param1 or Param2.
