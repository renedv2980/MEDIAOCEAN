You must set up an individual Product Record for each of your clients'         
products in the File Maintenance Program.  This record is used to establish a  
2-to-3 letter product code, and the name and address to which all this         
product's invoices will be sent.  Additionally, you may set up certain special 
products to handle corporate buying and special billing addresses.

You use the Demo Menu record to group several demo categories under one demo   
menu code.  Using demo menu codes lets you enter a single demo menu name       
instead of several demo categories.  Demo menu codes can be used to enter demo 
information in the Estimate Record, or to override demos on media reports.

You can enter up to 14 demo categories in the Demo Menu Record; the remaining  
six fields are for future use.  When you enter a demo menu code in the Esimate 
Record or when overriding demos on report requests, the system will display    
back the demo categories listed in the menu.

If you are to do pool buying and reporting on the pool, you must first set up  
an estimate for the pool to link products together for reporting.              
After you have set up the POL estimate record for a client, you may set up     
identical records for additional brands in one step.  To do this use the COPY  
action.  The COPY action copies certain estimate features for any combination  
of a client's products.  Authorized dollars on the initial POL estimate are not
copied to the products.

Do not use this feature if brand estimate records that you want to add are not 
all identical, since it is easier to enter non-identical records individually. 
If CPP estimates are used, note that the 'CPP EST' field should be filled in on
brand estimates only.

The Market Record is used to establish a 1-4 digit number to represent each    
radio and television market. 

It is recommended that you set up markets in numeric order matching the        
alphabetic order of the market names.  It is also a good idea to leave at least
a 5-digit gap between market numbers for expansion and correction.  You may    
request the SP48 Station File Listing Report for a hard copy listing of        
markets.  See "Requesting Printed Reports" for details.  

Split records allow entry of goals for multiple dayparts in a single-line entry
for each market.  A split record designates percentage figures for specific    
dayparts; when goals are entered without daypart reference each daypart marked 
in the split record is assigned its designated percentage of the market goal.  
Split records are only useful for clients who allocate the same percentage of  
budget dollars to dayparts across all (or most) markets.  Otherwise, it is     
easier to enter goals for each daypart individually.

If used, split records must be set up for each estimate.  Goals may still be   
added for specific dayparts without regard to the split record.  (See the Goals
program for goals input with split records.)
