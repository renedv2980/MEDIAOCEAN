         TITLE 'REFUSE  - Recovery File Search'                                 
Program reads any recovery disk/tape and filters according to input parameters  
given in control cards.                                                         
                                                                                
The file to be read must be specified in a //recvin dd statement.               
Output will either be directed to a dataset specified in a //recvout dd         
statement, printed, or both.

OUTPUT=<DISK,PRINT,BOTH>          DISK writes recovery records to recvout       
                                  dataset and also prints input parameters      
                                  and totals of records read and written.

                                  records, and totals of records read and       
                                  records written.  Also, the recovery          
                                  header is partially translated for bimbos.
