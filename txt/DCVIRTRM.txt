FAVIRTRM - ROUTINE TO HANDLE VIRTUAL TERMINALS                                  
----------------------------------------------                                  
FAVIRTRM IS A ROUTINE THAT IS DEFINED IN SYSFACS. IT CAN BE USED TO FIND        
A VIRTUAL TERMINAL BY PASSING ITS TOKEN AND IT CAN BE USED TO ADD OR            
DELETE A VIRTUAL TERMINAL.                                                      
                                                                                
THE INPUT PARAMETER LIST IS AS FOLLOWS

NOTE THAT IF THIS ROUTINE IS *INCLUDE'D INTO A SERVICE REQUEST THEN THE         
CALLER MUSTPASS V(SYSFACS) IN AN EXTRA 3RD PARAMETER.

FUNCTIONS 1 AND 2 REQUIRE P2 TO BE SET TO THE AL4(VIRTUAL TOKEN).               
THE FORMAT IS CL10'>FTTTTIIII" WHERE TTTT IS THE HEX VIRTUAL TERMINAL           
NUMBER AND IIII IS THE HEX CONTROL ID ASSIGNED WHEN THE VIRTUAL TERMINAL        
WAS FIRST CREATED.                                                              
                                                                                
OTHER FUCTIONS REQUIRE THAT THE AL4 ADDRESS OF A UTL ENTRY IS PASSED. IF        
P2 IS SET TO ZERO THEN THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE UTL ENTRY OF THE              
CALLER WILL BE USED.                                                            
                                                                                
IF THE RETURN CODE AT P1(1) IS NON ZERO THEN THE AL3 AT P1+1(3) POINTS          
TO A SHORT CL10 ERROR MESSAGE IN VIRTRM'S W/S.                                  
                                                                                
THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS WILL BE ILLUSTRATED BY SAMPLE CODE.
