 Connect program options are in the format KEYWORD=PARAM,KEYWORD=PARAM.... All  
 keywords must be present but need not be first in list. All keywords are valid 
 only for dds terminals.

 DDS=Y/N                Makes a DDS terminal into a user terminal and vice-versa
                        (Removes '*')                                           
                                                                                
 UPDATE=Y/N             Allows programs to run in READ-ONLY mode. (If IAM=XXX   
                        is also specified may also log updates to TSTRCVR)      
                                                                                
 IAM=XXXX               Links terminal with TSTTAB entry created with $TEST     
                        for CIL patching and logging updates when UPDATE=NO.)   
                                                                                
 AUTH=XXXX              Overrides connecting authorization in ID/TERM recs      
                        where XXXX is the hex authorization code.               
                                                                                
 CIL=Y/N                If 'Y' will do all CALLOV loads from the core-image     
                        library                                                 
                                                                                
 At any time you can change the test status of a program by inputting           
 $KEYWORD=PARAM (,KEYWORD=PARAM) in the service request field. Please note that 
 some test options also set others (i.e. T=A sets C=Y) to get around this use   
 T=A,C=N to turn off the CIL option when testing A/B/C phases from the phase    
 list.
