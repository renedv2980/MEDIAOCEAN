a) General code

   DXTRACT                                                                      
     General offline Facpak system data extract controller.                     
     Used for building flat files of mainframe data for updating                
     remote PC server data bases, (E.g. SQL database,) via ESS.                 
     Calls system specific sub programs which extract data from                 
     Facpak system files. Data is converted to a format tailored                
     to suit the particular application and the resulting 'Flat'                
     format records are written to an MVS data set for transfer                 
     to update the remote PC server database.                                   
     DXTRACT operates in Load or Update mode. Load mode is                      
     intended to call the system sub program which extracts                     
     database initialisation records directly from the system                   
     files. Update mode passes system recovery file records                     
     at periodic intervals, (from every hour to daily update,)                  
     from which the system sub program extracts data for updating               
     the database.                                                              
     The extract file is created with a header and trailer                      
     defining information used to control transfer and update                   
     of the data on the remote PC/ESS destination.                              
     DXTRACT can be driven by Xtract transfer control records                   
     on the control GEN file, including XAGENCY, XFILE, XTRANS                  
     and XAPPL record.                                                          
     Xtract transfer control records are updated to indicate                    
     when file is awaiting transfer to PC/ESS destination.
