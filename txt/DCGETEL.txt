         TITLE 'GETEL'                                                          
The GETEL macro generates code to find an element in a record.  A register      
contains the address of the record or an element within the record. Routine     
looks for an element code specified in a 1-byte field or any element if the     
field is zero.  After GETEL the condition code will be set to equal if an       
element was found and to not-equal if end of record was encountered and the     
register will address either the element or the end of the record.  (Note -     
GETEL code uses RF.)                                                            
                                                                                
         GETEL Rn,dd,cc           Rn is addressing register                     
                                  dd is displacement of first element in record 
                                        and may be an integer or the label of   
                                        a half-word containing the displacement 
                                                                                
                                  cc is the label of 1-byte field that contains 
                                        the searched-for element code.

Macro generates three labels that are entry points to the routine. They are     
used as follows:                                                                
                                                                                
         BAS   RE,GETEL           When register addresses the record.           
         BAS   RE,FIRSTEL         When register addresses first element.        
         BAS   RE,NEXTEL          When you need a further element.

Note - GETEL generates code to blow-up if elements of zero length are found.
