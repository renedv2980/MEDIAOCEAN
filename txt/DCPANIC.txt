         TITLE 'PANIC'                                                          
Module interfaces directly with PANVALET library.                               
                                                                                
You must have at least one DD statement in your JCL referencing a PAN           
library (usually PANDD1). PANIC also supports one concatenated library          
(PANDD11). If you are reading from a PAN backup dataset, use PANDD3.            
                                                                                
PANIC loads a re-entrant version of PAM, the Panvalet-supplied API to           
read from PAN libraries.

Parameter 5                  A(676-byte COMMENT and AUDIT area)                 
                              (Optional: is only filled in by PANIC if X'10' bit
                                         in HOB of P1 is set)                   
                                                                                
To read the directory =C'READ',=C'DIRECTORY',book,io                            
                        This will cause the 0-up entry to be read into io.      
                                                                                
To read book contents =C'READ',=C'PAN',book,io                                  
                        This will cause statements to be read into io           
                        one statement at a time.

To load PAM only      =C'LOAD'                                                  
                        This is normally not necessary. Do this early in your   
                        program to force PAM to be loaded, if you find yourself 
                        yourself running out of region size unexpectedly.
