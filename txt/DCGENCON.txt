                      Controller can be loaded in off line by SPOOF to handle

Activity              Action of ACT causes activity details to be displayed:-   
                      Date and ID of ADD, last change and reason for change.    
                      DDS terminals also see disk address and record length.

Screens               Should start on line 5, column 2.                         
                                                                                
                      There must be a 1 byte blank protected field after all    
                      the key fields, before any record fields.                 
                      LIST screens should have 15 3 byte unprotected select     
                      fields and 15 protected data display areas.               
                                                                                
Edit Modes            VALKEY     Validate the key fields                        
                      VALREC     Validate the record fields                     
                      DISPKEY    Display lowest level key fields                
                                 (this is only used for SELECT after LIST)      
                      DISPREC    Display the record fields                      
                                                                                
I/O Handling          Controller will handle all I/O for ADD, CHANGE, DISPLAY,  
                      DELECT, RESTORE, and SELECT automatically.                
                                                                                
                      Key is assumed to contain required key.                   
                                                                                
                      AIO has the address of the record.                        
                                                                                
                      Controller will come to application just before I/O       
                      with mode set to RECORD, RECPUT, RECDEL or RECREST.       
                                                                                
                      If I/O is inappropriate, GOTO1 ERREX.                     
                                                                                
                      You can stop the controller handling the ADDREC and       
                      PUTREC by setting IOOPT to "Y"                            
                                                                                
                      Controller will come to application after I/O to          
                      announce successful completion with MODE set to           
                      XRECADD, XRECPUT, XRECDEL or XRECREST.  This would be a   
                      good time to handle passive pointers for example.         
                                                                                
                      Activity elements (X'F1') will be maintained              
                      automatically by the controller, unless ACTELOPT = C'N'   
                                                                                
                      If you need to access a file other than the standard      
                      file and directory for your systems, fill FILENAME with   
                      required name and clear after use.                        
                                                                                
                      If you are accessing files without a directory, set       
                      USEIO = C'Y'.  This will cause READ HIGH SEQ functions to 
                      read into I/O area.                                       
                                                                                
List Handling         Controller will come to application with MODE set to      
                      LISTRECS.  KEY will either contain binary zeroes (first   
                      page of list) as will contain the key of the first record 
                      to shown.                                                 
                                                                                
                      Fill LISTAR with data to be displayed.  You then GOTO1    
                      LISTMON for each successful output, so that controller can
                      monitor disk addresses for subequent SELECT handling and  
                      exit when screen is filled.                               
                                                                                
Validation            Many common validation routines are provided as           
                      enterable routines in either the general or the           
                      system controllers.                                       
                                                                                
                      All these routines assume that R2 addresses field header. 
                                                                                
                      If an error is found routine will exit to screen          
                      immediately unless ERROPT is set to 'Y".                  
                                                                                
                      If you find an error, set ERROR to appropriate number and 
                      branch to TRAPERR which you code as:-                     
                                 TRAPERR GOTO1 ERREX                            
                                                                                
                      If you want to handle your own error message, fill CONHEAD
                      and GOTO1 ERREX2.                                         
                                                                                
Saved Area            If you wish part of the system work areas to be saved,    
                      set NTWA to a value from 1-3.  Controller will write      
                      storage starting at SYSD in chunks of 2304 bytes to       
                      TEMPSTR and will restore this storage next time in.  Be   
                      sure to reset NTWA to zero if you no longer require saves.
                                                                                
Activity              Controller maintains activity elements (X'F1'-see         
                      DDACTIVD).  A 2 Byte reason for change field (CHREASON)   
                      will be saved in that element.  When user asks for        
                      activity to be displayed, controller will come to         
                      application with MODE set to XPREASON.  Fill WORK with    
                      expanded reason for display.
