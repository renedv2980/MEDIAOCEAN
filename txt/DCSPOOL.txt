         TITLE 'SPOOL and SPOOLD'                                               
SPOOL is a comprehensive facility to help in the generation of on-line reports. 
Module works like REPORT function with off-line controllers.  Printing specs    
are assembled using SSPEC and SPROG macros.  SPOOLD covers a 3200 byte area and 
includes 14 head-lines, 2 mid-lines, 4 print-lines, HEADHOOK, MIDHOOK,          
ALLOWLIN, SPACING, PAGE, MAXLINES, FORCEHED, SPACES, MONTHS, etc.               
                                                                                
Some extra fields are needed for interfacing with Print Q facility.
