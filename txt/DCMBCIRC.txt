OVERVIEW                                                                        
--------                                                                        
   MBCIRC is one of the 'satellite'  modules that act as an                     
intermediary between the calling program and MBLOOK. It calls MBLOOK            
to find the right circulation data (properly qualified and dated),              
processes that data, and passes it back to the caller in an easy to             
use format.                                                                     
                                                                                
   To use MBCIRC It is necessary to refer to MBCIRCD as well as this            
document.                                                                       
                                                                                
PARAMETER LIST                                                                  
--------------                                                                  
   Like most MediaBase modules MBCIRC must be called with R1 pointing           
to MBPARMS/MBBLOCK.                                                             
                                                                                
   Parm 1   - A(Control Block) - covered by MBCIRCD                             
                                                                                
CALLER SET FIELDS                                                               
-----------------                                                               
  Fields that might require some explanation are:                               
                                                                                
  1) MBCGEO, MBCTYPE, and MBCSTYPE.                                             
       Each individual circ detail element as 3 identifying bytes.              
       Depending on the circ source/format the bytes can take on                
       different meanings. These 3 input controls provide a                     
       common way of getting at the right element. See MBCIRCD and              
       MBGENFILE for more detail.                                               
                                                                                
  2) MBCEDIT                                                                    
       Edition code if any. Circ must be on file for the specific               
       edition or no data is returned. This is the only qualifier               
       other than sometimes month or day of the week (which are                 
       handled specially - see below) that normally would be used               
       for circulation.                                                         
                                                                                
  3) MBCATAB                                                                    
       The caller passes MBCIRC the address where it can build                  
       a table of returned circ values. This table is covered                   
       by MBCTABD (part of MBCIRCD). MBCATABL is the size of the                
       table area in 256 byte chunks. (null=1)                                  
                                                                                
       The table is required unless only total circulation is                   
       needed in which case it is optional.                                     
                                                                                
  4) MBCCTL - There are 3 control bits used here.                               
       - MBCCDAYQ- Specific day of week  (**NOT CODED**)                        
         Some circ formats allow for different circ values for different        
         days of the week or the entire circ screen may be qualified by         
         day of week. In either case you can get MBCIRC to try for              
         specific day of week circ based on MBCDATE.                            
                                                                                
       - MBCCMTHQ- Specific month.  (**NOT CODED**)                             
         Some circ formats allow for different circ values for                  
         different month or the entire circ screen may be qualified by          
         month. In either case you can get MBCIRC to try for specific           
         month based on MBCDATE.                                                
                                                                                
       - MBCCTOTQ- "True total".  (**NOT CODED**)                               
         For some formats there is the notion of a "nominal total"              
         which may or may not be the "true total". This control bit             
         will force MBCIRC to calculate a true total.                           
                                                                                
FIELDS RETURNED BY MBCIRC                                                       
-------------------------                                                       
                                                                                
     Source, format, and circ effective dates come from the circ                
     header element. Source and format names can be looked up                   
     using MBVAL if needed. If MBCDATE is after the latest applicable           
     circ on file then the latest is used.                                      
                                                                                
     Total circ is returned in both in MBCTCIRC and in the circ value           
     table at MBCATAB, if present.
