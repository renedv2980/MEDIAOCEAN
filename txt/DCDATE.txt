         TITLE 'DATE'                                                           
                                                                                
Macro that generates a set of code to return in a named eight byte area the date
and/or country code.                                                            
                                                                                
(Name)   DATE   outarea(,DATE=NO)                                               
                                                                                
Outarea is the address of an eight byte area. If ommitted it is assumed that RF 
points to this area. If quoted as (Rx) then Rx contains the address of the area,
otherwise it is assumed that outarea is the name of an eight byte area. The     
format of the output area is C'YYMMDDXX" WHERE XX is the country code C'UK' or  
C'US'.                                                                          
                                                                                
If DATE=NO is quoted as a parameter then only the last two bytes of outarea are 
set to the country code.                                                        
                                                                                
The DATE macro generates a lot of code and uses R0, R1, RE and RF. It should be 
used in a module that has no access to V(DATCON) as DATCON can get today's date 
with an input type 5 and return C'YYMMDD' format with an output type 0.
