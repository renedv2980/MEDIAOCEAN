         TITLE 'DATCON'                                                         
Converts different format dates for US and UK. These dates have been            
redefined so that dates in the range 1900 thru 2027 are supported. As           
long as DATVAL and DATCON and other DDS date routines are used then the         
changes for the year 2000 should be transparent. The changes that have          
been made to the major date types are as follows. Note that the PWOS            
date is no longer a valid packed number and that the C'YYMMDD' is not           
printable for 21st century dates.                                               
                                                                                
C'YYMMDD'   0-1st year byte set to X'FA' for 1st decade of 21st cent.           
P'YMD'      1-1st year nibble set to X'A' for 1st decade of 21st cent           
X'XX'       2-Year (1st 7 bits) has 100 added on for 21st century.              
X'YMD'      3-Year byte has 100 added on for 21st century dates.                
C'DD/MM/YY' 4-Assume 21st century date if YY GE 00 and LE 27.                   
              Assume 20th century date if YY GE 28 and LE 99.                   
                                                                                
As an aid to conversion input type 0, C'YYMMDD', will assume that dates         
C'00....' thru C'27....' are 2000 thru 2027. This means that 1900 thru          
1927 will not be supported by input type 0, but that likely forms of            
2 digit year dates that are present in interface tapes will be converted        
to their most probable meaning. Output dates, however, will be in DDS           
standard internal format unless specifically requested not be by setting        
P2(1) to X'20' for output types 0 thru 3.                                       
                                                                                
Parameter 1 byte  0       Input type in low order four bits.                    
                          X'80'=Set len of output field in P2(1)                
                          X'40'=Set any alpha text to lower case

Parameter 2 byte  0       Output type in low order five bits.                   
                          X'80'=Append period text to output date(s)

            bytes 1-3     A(output date)                                        
                                                                                
Parameter 3 byte  0       Date modifier - must be set if P1(1)=X'30'            
            bytes 1-3     A(second input date if X'20' bit on in P1)            
                                                                                
If the input type value has X'80' bit set on then the output type byte          
is overridden by the actual length of the output date(s).                       
                                                                                
If the input type value has X'40' bit set on and if the format used in          
the output date(s) has a three chr month name,then the month will be            
set to lower case eg JAN to Jan. Also any period text will be set to            
lower case also eg PERIOD FROM to Period from.                                  
                                                                                
If the input type value has both the X'20' and the X'10' bits on then           
the output date will be adjusted to the first/last day of the input             
month, or the prev/next month.                                                  
                                                                                
If the input type value has the X'10' bit set on then the input is two          
dates with the second date passed immediately behind the first date             
passed in param 1. If the input type value has the X'20' bit set on             
the second input date is passed as a separate field pointed to by an            
extra param 3. When two dates are passed the output area contains the           
two output dates separated by a single hyphen character.                        
                                                                                
If a pair of dates is passed then if the X'80' bit is set on in the             
output type value then the date(s) will be treated as a period that is          
described by extra text data. If one of the dates is not present (ie            
the input date is year zero, month zero, and day zero the period text           
will change to reflect the absence of one or other dates. The output            
format is in one of three forms (in lower case format)                          
Period DATE1 - DATE2                                                            
Period from DATE1                                                               
Period to DATE2                                                                 
                                                                                
If the X'20' bit is turned on in the output type value then the                 
conversions of the year to DDS internal will NOT be done for the four           
basic output types 0 through 3. This may be useful for output type 0            
(C'YYMMDD') when outputting an EBCDIC date on an interface tape.

Compressed format is 2 bytes where bits 0-6 = year, bits 7-10 = month, bits     
11-15 = day. The numbers in Parens show the output type number that             
datcon automatically switches to if the day value input is zero.                
                                                                                
Special date manipulation                                                       
-------------------------                                                       
If P1(1)=X'30' (both bits X'10' and X'20') then the output date                 
can be modified based on the value passed in P3(1) to one of a                  
set of common date manipulations required.

    2          First day of next month after input month                        
    3          Last day of next month after input month                         
    4          First day of month before input month                            
    5          Last day of month before input month                             
                                                                                
The input/output types should be unaffected by the use of this function         
                                                                                
Date and Time manipulation                                                      
--------------------------                                                      
Calling DATCON with input type 5 causes the date in 4-byte julian format        
and the time now in 4-byte binary seconds to be saved in consectutive           
locations in local working storage. The input address parameter P1+1(3)         
for date type 5 call is set to point to this 8-byte area. The following         
sample code shows how to use this info to get various date/time info            
with one call to DATCON. Note that P1+1(3) is not required on an input          
type 5 call so it does not matter what is passed. In this example we set
