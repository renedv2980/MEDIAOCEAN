 -----------------------                    ------                              
                                                                                
     GOTO1 WORKER,P1,=C'INDEX',FILE,ID      Pass the first index record if ID   
                                            is zero, the next if ID is the same 
                                            as previous, or else pass this ID.  
                                            Index records are 16 bytes long -

     GOTO1 WORKER,P1,=C'ADD',FILE,ID,IO     Adds a record to file for this ID.  
                                            If this is first add for this ID, a 
                                            new index record is created.  If a  
                                            previous index with the same ID is  
                                            on file, this is deleted.  If this  
                                            is the first add of run, WORKER     
                                            waits until file is not busy and    
                                            then sets file to busy status.

WORKER supports variable length records and standard IBM conventions are used.  
Thus, the first two bytes of record = H'length' and the next two bytes = H'0'.
