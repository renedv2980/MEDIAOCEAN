  This screen controls access to the survey data. Access can be                 
allowed for the whole file, only certain sections of the file, or not           
at all.                                                                         
                                                                                
  The surveys may be divided into access sections, each given a number          
between 1 and 255. Each card/column/punch is assigned an access code            
when the file is inverted.  The code is checked against the list of             
codes allowed or denied for the agency.

If the sample size for a given count falls                                      
below certain limits, it is usually necessary                                   
to note that fact on any tables or reports.                                     
There are normally two thresholds.

**DDS ONLY**                                                                    
                                                                                
  Surveys may consist of multiple 'waves' or releases representing              
data collected during different survey periods. Each wave for a survey          
must be identical (or virtually so) in its code-book structure.                 
Each wave represents a different set of respondents, not the same               
set asked the same questions at a later date.                                   
                                                                                
  Waves are identified by month and year.                                       
                                                                                
  The data required by the system for a wave is entered on this screen.         
It must be added even if there is only one wave.                                
                                                                                
  Waves for a survey may be merged or not merged. Merged means that             
the different waves are combined together to appear as one respondent           
set on one logical file. Not merged means that each wave is handled             
as a separate unit, though multiple waves may be added together for             
reporting and may co-exist on the same physical file.                           
                                                                                
 Whether waves are merged or not is determined by how the files are             
made available by the survey company. NRS waves are not merged.

Start the listing at this response                                              
function code.                                                                  
<fd>owner.                                                                      
The owner code acts as a filter.                                                
                                                                                
  If the filter you enter is preceeded by an '(' (meaning 'includes'),          
all targets with owners containing the filter string in any position            
will be listed.                                                                 
                                                                                
  e.g.- a filter of '(ABC' will pass all those with 'ABC' anywhere in           
        the owner field.                                                        
                                                                                
  If the filter is not preceeded by an '(' the record owner is compared         
directly to it starting at position one. *'s may be used to suppress            
filtering on specific positions.                                                
                                                                                
  e.g.- a filter of 'AB' will list all records with owners starting             
        with 'AB'.                                                              
        '**AB' will pass all those with 'AB' in positions 3 and 4.

<t>QSPECS                                                                       
<h0>SCREEN INTRODUCTION                                                         
  The following screens illustrate how DDS will maintain the                    
Qspec file. They show the data involved at each level of a                      
Qspec and how the sequencing is controlled. Users will have                     
access to Qspecs on a read only basis.                                          
                                                                                
  Qspecs consist of up to three parts- Topic, Question, and Answer.             
                                                                                
  There are not, however, separate key fields for each part.  Instead,          
the complete Qspec is entered at once as TOPIC.QUESTION.ANSWER.  You            
must set up the parts individually- before you can add questions                
within a topic you must add the topic, and so forth.                            
                                                                                
  A 'Question', however, can be set up without a topic, and an 'answer'         
can be set up without a topic or question. These are called 'stand-             
alones'.                                                                        
                                                                                
  When you are adding Qspecs to the file you must identify them (in             
the RECORD field) as topics, questions, or answers. For other                   
maintenance functions a record type of QSPEC can also be used;                  
the system will automatically bring up the appropriate screen for the           
record involved.                                                                
                                                                                
  Qspecs will generally be displayed, both on screen lists and                  
cross-tab reports, in the order in which they were input, not in order          
of their alphabetic codes. This is true for topics, questions, and              
answers. The printing order can, however, be changed within each                
level. See the Qspec List screen.                                               
                                                                                
  Qspecs can be grouped into 'categories'. This is accomplished                 
by positioning special qspecs (which must start with an *)                      
before a set of related specs. For instance, *DEMO might be                     
placed before topics or stand-alone questions or answers                        
relating to age, sex, social grade, etc. Note that these                        
'categories' do not form part of the actual qspec code- you                     
don't have to type it in when you use the qspec. They exist only                
to help you find the qspec codes for a subject you might be                     
interested in. See the QSPEC LIST screen for more on how to                     
use categories.                                                                 
                                                                                
  Qspecs are related to the card/column/punch data of the survey file           
through the specification fields in which you state the logical                 
condition that defines the qspec using the Logical Specification                
Language.                                                                       
                                                                                
  There is a simple copy function available to reduce inputting. Also           
special sets of Qspecs, called 'library groups', can be set up and              
invoked over and over again, using parameter substitution to replace            
fields that change with each use. Library groups can save a lot of              
inputting, prevent errors, and conserve file space.

     arithmetic value or range of values. Enter                                 
     the value or the mid-point of the range.                                   
                                                                                
  3. Numeric fields. The answers set up as Qspecs                               
     will usually be ranges of values. Normally,                                
     you would enter the mid-point of the range.

    no records at the next level.)                                              
                                                                                
You can move a record from one 'page' of the list                               
to another by scrolling to the desired page and                                 
then completing the move request.                                               
                                                                                
When you move a topic all of its questions and                                  
answers follow along with it. When you move a                                   
question all of its answers follow along.                                       
                                                                                
You cannot mix the various 'move' commands                                      
with the standard select options such as                                        
select, change, etc.                                                            
                                                                                
NOTE- The select options D (delete) and                                         
      R (restore) are not supported for                                         
      qspecs.                                                                   
      Also C (change) is ok only if                                             
      the type (T,Q,A) of the qspec you want                                    
      to change agrees with the type in the                                     
      RECORD field above. So on a 'QSPEC'                                       
      list, for instance, no changes are                                        
      allowed.

  RENAME allows you to change the code of a qspec.  You can do a                
RENAME even if you have already set up lower level records belonging

one and then ammending it can save a lot of inputting.

  Blocks of questions or answers that appear repeatedly in the                  
code-book can be set up once as a 'library group' of Qspecs and                 
invoked over and over again as needed. Library groups are set up as             
normal Qspecs but are identified by a $ as the first character of the           
leading Qspec. They can be a set of questions and answers to be used            
within multiple topics or a set of answers to be used within multiple           
questions.                                                                      
                                                                                
  A library group is a prototype. Each time it is invoked, certain              
information, particularly card and column numbers and perhaps part of           
the annotation will be different and will have to be supplied. Such             
items are coded as symbolic parameters in the library group and are             
replaced via parameter substitution when it is used.  Symbolic                  
parameters are entered with an '&&' as in &&CARD, &&COL, &&BRAND, etc.          
                                                                                
  The following series of screens illustrates how to set up a simple            
library group.                                                                  
<pa>                                                                            
~QSPEC

In this case the library group consists of a question and its                   
answers and so is set up as if it were a topic.                                 
                                                                                
This first entry just serves to establish the existence of                      
library group $BRS and to give it a title.

Enter the code of the qspec to which                                            
the library group is to be attached.

Enter the code of the library group header,                                     
preceded by a $. The header must be of the                                      
same qspec type (topic, question, or answer)                                    
as the qspec to which it is to be attached.                                     
                                                                                
If you leave the field blank and the qspec                                      
already has a library group attached, the                                       
header code and the current parameter substitutions                             
will be displayed.                                                              
                                                                                
If a library group is already attached to the                                   
qspec and you wish to attach a different one,                                   
you must first remove the current one by entering                               
'DELETE' in the library header field.                                           
<fd>substitution value.                                                         
The &&parameters found in the library group                                     
are listed, and you are asked to supply                                         
the replacement values.                                                         
If you leave the value field blank or enter                                     
'DELETE', the line or lines on the original                                     
library member screen will be deleted in the                                    
called version.  This should be particularly                                    
useful for qspecs that are defined for some                                     
waves but not for others (as for publications).                                 
<fd>exclusions.                                                                 
You can also cause specific members of the                                      
library group to be excluded for this call by                                   
entering their codes in the exclusion fields.                                   
<einput>                                                                        
                                                                                
 The library group being called is searched for symbolic parameters.            
 In this case &&BRAND and &&CC were found. These are listed out for             
 you and all you have to do is supply the replacements.                         
                                                                                
The answer screen on the previous page shows the &&CC parameter being           
used in the expression 'CD &&CC 5'. After substitution this becomes             
'CD 38*15 5'.

  Targets are user-defined groups within the population. They are used          
in readership research reports and cross-tabs.                                  
                                                                                
  There are also DDS standard targets, which are maintained by DDS,             
and can be accessed by agencies on a read-only basis. DDS targets               
will be set up to cover most of the standard age/sex/social class               
demographics.

(Agency targets only.)                                                          
                                                                                
The owner code acts as a filter.                                                
                                                                                
  If the filter you enter is preceeded by an '(' (meaning 'includes'),          
all targets with owners containing the filter string in any position            
will be listed.                                                                 
                                                                                
  e.g.- a filter of '(ABC' will pass all those with 'ABC' anywhere in           
        the owner field.                                                        
                                                                                
  If the filter is not preceeded by an '(' the record owner is compared         
directly to it starting at position one. *'s may be used to suppress            
filtering on specific positions.                                                
                                                                                
  e.g.- a filter of 'AB' will list all targets with owners starting             
        with 'AB'.                                                              
        '**AB' will pass all those with 'AB' in positions 3 and 4.
