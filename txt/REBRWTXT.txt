*** USING GLOBBER TO INVOKE BROWSE ***                                          
                                                                                
Data set REGLBRW is dsect for globber data element used for passing             
parameters to Browse. Set up a call as follows:                                 
  GLBRWKW: (Optional) Keyword string to filter records. Users will be           
           able to change the keyword string while in Browse or specify         
           one if no string was passed. Field can be null or space              
           padded.                                                              
 GLBRWREC: (Required) 3 Character record code specifying the type of            
           records (eg. AGY,ADV) to be browsed. This code must                  
           correspond to an entry in the table RECTAB in REBRW00.               
  GLBRWRD: (Not used when invoking Browse)                                      
 GLBRWFLG: (Null for no options) Bits are for various record processing         
           options. Meaning of bits depends on record code being used.          
           Full description of these bits is located with the                   
           definition of the field OPTIONS in REBRW00.                          
                                                                                
Browse will create a Globber control elem to return to the calling              
program when finished. In the case that the user selects Cancel (PF12)          
while in Browse, a Globber Browse data element (GLBRWEL) will not be            
created.                                                                        
                                                                                
In the case that Browse is called, but based on the keyword criteria            
(if any keyword is provided), no records are selected, Browse will              
immediately return to the caller program and return a Globber Browse            
data element with the field GLBRWKW containing nulls.                           
                                                                                
When Browse is done, the Globber Browse data element (GLBRWEL) will             
contain the following:                                                          
  GLBRWKW: Contains code or other key information that was looked up            
           for theat particular record type. Null padded.                       
           If 0 records selcted on first call to Browse, Browse will            
           immediately return to calling program, & this field will             
           be nulls.                                                            
 GLBRWREC: Will still contain the record code for the type of record            
           that was used.                                                       
  GLBRWRD: Contains the full or expanded name/description of the                
           record selected.
