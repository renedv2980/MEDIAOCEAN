A new input option in the FIS program lets you browse through markets and      
stations sequentially without entering market or station codes.

Previously, you had to enter the specific market or station codes to display   
information for a market and station.  Now, if you enter 'NEXT' in the MARKET  
or STATION field, the system will find the next active market or station for   
the client/product/estimate you have specified.
