PRTQXFR Program

The print queue transer program transfers a report or file between the          
print queue and an MVS data set. It is similar in concept to the print          
queue maint program (PRTQM) which copies print queue reports to and             
from a backup tape.                                                             
                                                                                
Transfering a report from the PQ to an MVS data set                             
---------------------------------------------------                             
The print queue files are defined by standard DD statements, or if no           
DMPRTQ DD statements are present, then dynamic allocation will default          
to the production ADV files.                                                    
                                                                                
The MVS data set is defined completely by a //MVSOUT DD statement that          
must be included in the JCL. There are no definitions in the PRTQXFR            
program, so the file attributes must be in the catalogue, or defined on         
the DD statement itself (eg RECSIZE,BLKSIZE,DSN etc ).                          
                                                                                
The report(s) that are to be selected from the print queue are defined          
by a set of parameter cards. A single report can be transfered by               
quoting just two parameters :-                                                  
USER=USERID         where userid is the alpha user id                           
REPORT=XXX,99999    where XXX is the report id and 99999 is report num.         
                                                                                
Sample JCL as follows

The print queue files are defined by standard DD statements, or if no           
DMPRTQ DD statements are present, then dynamic allocation will default          
to the production ADV files.                                                    
                                                                                
The MVS data set is defined completely by a //MVSIN DD statement that           
must be included in the JCL. There are no definitions in the PRTQXFR            
program, so the file attributes must be in the catalogue, or defined on         
the DD statment itself (eg RECSIZE,BLKSIZE,DSN etc ).                           
                                                                                
When a report is written to the print queue it must be filed under a            
valid user id and it must be assign a one thru three chr name. If these         
are the only values defined then all the other print queue attributes           
will be assigned default values. Note that the main default is that the         
report consists of 132 chr print lines preceeded by an IBM carriage             
control character. This attribute can be defined by the TYPE= parameter         
defined below. The attributes that can be assigned are given by the             
following parameter cards :                                                     
                                                                                
USER=userid   Required param. Must be a valid User Id name.                     
REPORT=XXX    Required param. Report name. One thru three chrs.                 
CDATE=date    Creation date. Defaults to today's date.                          
CLASS=x       Report Class. A-Z or 0-9. Defaults to no class.                   
STATUS=x      Report Status. A,H,K. Defaults to A (active).                     
LRETN=nnn     Live retain hours. 0 thru 999 or PERM.                            
DRETN=nnn     Dead retain hours. 0 thru 999 or PERM.                            
DESC=XXX...   Report description. 1 thru 11 chrs.

CHARS=xxxx    Character set code.                                               
PSWD=xxxxxx   Password. 1 thru 6 chrs. If assigned must be quoted to see        
              or print the report in Facpak.                                    
TYPE=XXnnn    Report type. Defaults to FC132.                                   
              First chr must be F=fixed length records, V=variable len          
              records, or *=same as MVSIN file.                                 
              Second chr must be C=insert a CC chr on the front of each         
              record, N=No CC Chr (remove if there is one in MVSIN), or         
              *=same as MVSIN file (ie if there is one in the MVSIN file        
              include it in the PQ report)                                      
              nnn=the fixed record length. If not defined and MVSIN             
              file has f/l records, nnn will be set to the record len.          
              If input file has v/l records nnn will be set to the              
              nominal value of 99. PQ supports f/l records up to 255            
              bytes long. Longer records must be defined as v/l. v/l            
              records in the PQ have the first TWO bytes defining the           
              record length including the 2 bytes of the header.                
              TYPE=* should be used to create a binary v/l file if the          
              MVSIN file contains binary data.                                  
                                                                                
Sample JCL as follows                                                           
                                                                                
//         EXEC PGM=PRTQXFR,....                                                
..

//SYSIN    DD   *                                                               
MODE=COPY,INPUT=MVS

/*                                                                              
                                                                                
In this example the records in MVSIN will be written to the PQ as               
80 chr fixed length records with no CC chr. If we had said TYPE=*               
then the records in the PQ report ABC will have the same structure as           
the records in MVSIN file. TYPE=* should thus be used to transfer an            
MVS file containing v/l binary records to the PQ. Note that the max             
v/l record supported by PQ is 1024 bytes.                                       
                                                                                
After the report is added to the PQ a small printout on SYSOUT will show        
the PQ report attributes and the assigned report number.                        
                                                                                
Overwriting a report from an MVS data set to the PQ - MODE=REPLACE              
------------------------------------------------------------------              
The above example shows that MODE=COPY,INPUT=MVS,.... can be used to            
transfer a report from an MVS data set to the PQ. If the report already         
exists on the PQ,and the requirement is to replace or overwrite the PQ          
report with a new updated version held on an MVS data set then using            
MODE=REPLACE will cause the report to be replaced. There is no need to          
specify INPUT= and/or OUTPUT= as these will default to INPUT=MVS and            
OUTPUT=PQ. If INPUT= is specified with MODE=REPLACE then it must be             
defined as MVS, and if OUTPUT= is specified then it must be defined as          
PQ.
