WORKER supports variable length records and standard IBM conventions are used.  
Thus, the first two bytes of record = H'length' and the next two bytes = H'0'.  
                                                                                
                                                                                
The file is called WKFILE and it is a formal DATAMGR file in the SYSFILES       
system.  It is processed by the object module DMWRKR, and maintained off line   
by the WKMAINT program.  Any link edits that use the new worker should contain  
the following object modules:                                                   
                                                                                
     INCLUDE DMFILES,(DMCNTL,SYSIFLES,.....)                                    
     INCLUDE DMDARPS                                                            
     INCLUDE DMWRKR                                                             
     INCLUDE DMENQDEQ

In addition, if accessed via DATAMGR, then DATAMGR should be included.  There   
is also a DMWRKRB relo module that defines a 4K buffer if it is not convenient  
to define a buffer in a calling program

The processing module DMWRKR requires 610 double words of working storage and   
has two entry points V(WORKER) and V(DMWRKR).  The first entry point has been   
provided to maintain compatibility with existing programs, and the parameter    
list is the same as before except that the DTF is replaced by a 4K buffer.

               bytes 1-3     A(=C'action')                                      
                                                                                
Parameter 2                  A(4K buffer)                                       
                                                                                
Parameter 3    byte  0       Set to EOF, disk error, not found                  
               bytes 1-3     A(16 character index)

The second entry point is used only by DATAMGR when the normal DMCB call is as  
follows:

The files that reside in WKFILE have a new format 8 byte key with the format    
UUSPPXDC where S=System, PP=Program, X=Sub Program/Value, D=Day number (PWOS),  
C=Class and UU=User ID number.  All files must have a user ID and               
System/Program, all other fields must be binary zeros if not defined.  The key  
is the first 8 bytes of the index entry.  The next 8 bytes form the remainder   
of the 16 byte entry.  They should be set to binary zeros and left alone.  The  
full definition of the index entry is given bt the PAN book DMWRKRK, which      
defines the user key given by Parameter 3.

takes place on the first three characters only.  The actions are as follows:    
                                                                                
ADD      Add a record to file                                                   
CLOSE    Close the file                                                         
DELETE   Set file status to dead/deleted (X'20)                                 
HOLD     Set file status to hold (X'40')                                        
INDEX    Read index records into parameter 3                                    
KEEP     Set file status to keep (X'08')                                        
OPEN     Open a new file                                                        
PURGE    Purge the file                                                         
READ     Read file data record                                                  
RESTORE  Set file status to active (X'80')                                      
SEQ      Read index records/data in special format                              
UNKEEP   Turn off keep status                                                   
WRITE    Write back last file data record read                                  
                                                                                
The actions ADD, CLOSE, DELETE, INDEX, READ, RESTORE and WRITE exist in the Old 
Worker and function in a similar manner in the new.  The new actions HOLD,      
KEEP, PURGE and UNKEEP are extensions to the status change commands             
DELETE/RESTORE.  The new actions OPEN and SEQ can be used to new extended       
features.                                                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
OPEN Command                                                                    
                                                                                
The WORKER software does an implicit OPEN when an ADD command with a new key in 
the index parameter is encountered.  The file created is a standard WORKER data 
file whose status is active.  If the key already exists the new file overwrites 
the old file i.e., no duplicate keys are allowed.                               
                                                                                
The use of the explicit OPEN command before the first ADD allows the caller to  
specify one or more of the following features:                                  
                                                                                
1)   Allow duplicate keys.                                                      
2)   Specify the file to be a library file.                                     
3)   Set the status of the file (eg KEEP).                                      
4)   Set the creation date and time.                                            
5)   Set a value for the retention date.                                        
6)   Set a value for a 16 character comment for the file.                       
                                                                                
The OPEN command is invoked with the call to DATAMGR with a parameter list of   
the format:-                                                                    
                                                                                
     =C'OPEN',=C'WKFILE',INDEX,REC,BUFF                                         
                                                                                
Before the OPEN command the user must fill values into INDEX and REC where      
appropriate.  As usual the INDEX area is covered by the UKRECD dsect.  The      
                                                                                
sixteen byte index area should be set to binary zeros and the required key set  
in the first eight bytes.  OPEN uses flags that can be set in UKSTAT at         
INDEX+12 and in UKFLAG at INDEX+13.                                             
                                                                                
If the caller wishes the file to be created with a status other than ACTIVE the 
UKSTAT field can be set as follows:                                             
                                                                                
     X'40' = Creates file with HOLD status.                                     
     X'08' = Creates file with KEEP status.                                     
                                                                                
The UKFLAG field is defined as follows:                                         
                                                                                
     X'80' = Key value is in REC (ignore UKKEY value).                          
     X'40' = Status value is in REC (ignore UKSTAT value).                      
     X'20' = Date/time is in REC (else date and time now).                      
     X'10' = Retention days is in REC (else zero).                              
     X'08' = Comment data is in REC (else nulls).                               
     X'02' = Creates file in library format (else data format).                 
     X'01' = Allow duplicates for this key value (else no dups).                
                                                                                
The data record has a special format that defines all the attributes of a       
WORKER file.  The REC area is 96 bytes long.  The first 28 bytes contain header 
data for the WORKER system.  The next 64 bytes contain the file attributes.     
This area is covered by the WKRECD dsect given by the pan book DMWRKRD.  The    
dsect is as follows:

If the caller sets UKFLAG=X'80' the file key must be set in WKKEY.              
If the caller sets UKFLAG=X'40' the file is created with a status value set in  
WKSTAT.                                                                         
If the caller sets UKFLAG=X'20' the date and time must be set in WKAGED and     
WKAGET.                                                                         
If the caller sets UKFLAG=X'10' the retention days must be set in WKRETN as a   
halfword containing the number of days.                                         
If the caller sets UKFLAG='08' a 16 byte comment must be set into WKCOMNT.      
                                                                                
As an example of the user of OPEN, the following code will create a file in     
KEEP status with a retention of 14 days with an attached comment.  Duplicate    
keys are allowed.

After the close the first 64 bytes of BUFF contain the definition of the file   
just added.  The WKRECD dsect covers this area i.e. info such as the number of  
records, date/time created, file sequence number, etc. are available.  Note     
also that after the OPEN BUFF also contains some of this info, and that UKFILNO 
contains the file sequence number and UKCIADDR contains the disk address of the 
first block.                                                                    
                                                                                
 Changing File Attributes                                                       
 ------------------------                                                       
                                                                                
Once an existing WORKER file has been located by the INDEX read command,        
special commands are available to change or set certain file attributes.  The   
following actions can be used to change the status.                             
                                                                                
DELETE                  Set file status to dead/deleted (X'20')                 
HOLD                    Set file status to HOLD (X'40')                         
KEEP                    Set file status to KEEP (X'08')                         
PURGE                   Remove file completely                                  
RESTORE                 Set file status to ACTIVE (X'80')                       
UNKEEP                  Remove KEEP status                                      
                                                                                
The KEY action can be used to change the key of the file.  The new key is set   
in UKKEY.  This key must have the same user ID of the old key.                  
                                                                                
The RETAIN action can be used to change or set the retention days of the file.  
The new value must be set in the WKRETN field of the REC area as defined for    
OPEN.  NB. dsect starts at REC+28.                                              
                                                                                
The COMMENT action can be used to change or set the comment data of the file.   
The new 16 byte value must be set in the WKCOMNT field of the REC area as       
defined for OPEN.  NB.  dsect starts at REC+28.                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
 WORKER Buffer Save and Restore                                                 
 ------------------------------                                                 
                                                                                
All interrelated WORKER actions require that the same 4K buffer be passed.      
This buffer is used by the WORKER software to control the valid sequence of     
WORKER actions.  In the online environment the buffer is usually in temporary   
working storage so that it is necessary to save and restore the buffer across   
transactions if the same WORKER file is being processed.  However saving 4K of  
data in an TWA is not possible, so that special save and restore buffer         
commands are available that save only critical data to optimize disk I/O.  The  
user must provide a twenty byte area pointed to by the REC parameter field.     
This area containing the 16 byte INDEX area and a 4 byte disk address.  The     
WORKER actions are as follows:                                                  
                                                                                
BUFFER - initialize a buffer                                                    
BURSTR - restore a buffer                                                       
BUSAVE - save a buffer                                                          
                                                                                
Sample coding is as follows:

 -------------                                                                  
                                                                                
A WORKER library file is a special WORKER file that allows random               
adds/changes/deletes of individual records.  This is done by using the LIBRARY  
action with a special extended index area.  The normal index area is a sixteen  
byte record defined by the UKRECD dsect.  The index area of a WORKER library    
file contains the standard 16 byte area with a special 16 byte extension.  The  
extension area is also defined by the UKRECD dsect with the following extra     
fields:

The library action names are as follows:                                        
                                                                                
ADD                     Add a record at UKLREC1                                 
CLO                     Terminate a sequence of library actions                 
DEL                     Delete UKLREC1 through UKLREC2 records                  
GET                     Get record defined by UKLREC1                           
PUT                     Put record defined by UKLREC1                           
                                                                                
Library records are numbered starting at one.  For ADD the record number        
defined by UKLREC1 is the location to add the record eg, if 2 is quoted the     
record becomes the new record 2 and the old record 2 becomes record 3 etc.      
The record number zero is allowed for ADD and means the end of the file, i.e.   
it becomes the new last record.  After a sequence of library actions that       
update a library file (i.e. ADDs and PUTs) a CLO must be issued to force the    
last disk I/O required to complete the sequence.                                
                                                                                
A library file must first be created with a normal OPEN action with UKFLAG set  
to X'02' followed by a CLOSE action.  Records can also be loaded at creation    
time with normal ADD actions between the OPEN and CLOSE.  Note that a WORKER    
library file can be created with no records at all, and subsequently build with 
the LIBRARY action with ADD sub commands.                                       
                                                                                
To perform LIBRARY actions the WORKER file must first be located by the normal  
INDEX action (a library file is also located by OPEN/CLOSE i.e. at creation     
time).  Once the file is thus defined (and is in fact a library file) any valid 
sequence of library actions can be performed by setting the WORKER action to    
LIBRARY and by setting the library function required in the UKLACTN field of    
the extended INDEX area.  After each LIBRARY action the UKLRECS field is always 
set to the current number of records in the library file.                       
                                                                                
The following instructions must be adhered to:                                  
                                                                                
1)   The record length in the first two bytes of REC has a maximum value od     
     1024.                                                                      
2)   A PUT library function must follow a GET library function and cannot       
     change the record length.                                                  
3)  A library file can contain a maximum of 1500 records.
