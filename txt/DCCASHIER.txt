  CASHIER maintains a TSAR buffer of bill and cash applied data.                
General format of a buffer record is a copy of the bill record                  
followed by the media posting and cash applied transaction elements             
from ACCPAK. Each buffer record is keyed by the bill record key.                
Optionally, either the bill or cash applied data can be excluded from           
the buffer record.                                                              
                                                                                
 GENRAL APPROACH                                                                
 ---------------                                                                
                                                                                
CASHIER takes a BILL record, finds the related Media                            
      Transfer and Transaction records in ACC. From these records               
      it extracts the posting and cash applied elements. If cash has            
      not been fully applied it creates an extra element with id                
      X'FF' that represents the cash still to be applied.                       
      All data is accumulated in a variable length record and stored            
      a TSAR buffer above the line. Storage and retrieval are by                
      BILL keys.                                                                
                                                                                
      Since each media system has its own key for BILL records, code            
      will have to be added to formulate the Media Transfer Keys from           
      the BILL keys of each system.                                             
                                                                                
COMMANDS  Set in CSHACT  (See DDCASHIERD)                                       
--------                                                                        
                                                                                
CSHINIQ  -  INITIALIZE CASHIER. Mainly, allows CASHIER to retrieve              
            storage above the line and initialize TSAROFF.                      
            This command can be issued any number of times so long              
            as the buffer remains the same size. I.E. CASHIER will              
            get buffer storage only the first time this command is              
            issued. If you need to change the size of the buffer,               
            issue a CLOSE command (CSHCLSQ) first.                              
                                                                                
CSHADDQ  -  ADD a record to the buffer. CSHBLLA must point to a                 
            BILL record. On return, CSHRECA points to                           
            a copy of the record added. Only a copy because the                 
            buffer is above the line.                                           
                                                                                
CSHRDHQ  -  READ EQUAL OR HIGH for the bill record key pointed to by            
            CSHBLLA. On return CSHRECA points to the found record.              
                                                                                
CSHNXTQ  -  READ NEXT record in buffer.                                         
                                                                                
CSHCLSQ  -  CLOSE buffer and release storage. You must do this at the           
            end of the run.                                                     
                                                                                
ERRORS  - CSHERR - set to X'FF' if a non-retrievable type error occurs.         
          Simple not found errors must be determined by the caller              
          by comparing the key asked for to what was found.

CSHBLLL   - Maximum bill record length. Cash data is stored after               
            this length if the bill record is being included in                 
            record.                                                             
                                                                                
CSHBLLA   - A(Bill record) on an add. On retrieval only the key is              
            needed.                                                             
                                                                                
CSHRECA   - A(record added or retrieved). A copy actually because               
            the buffer is above the line.
