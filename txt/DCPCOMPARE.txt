GENERAL INFORMATION                                                             
------- -----------                                                             
                                                                                
   The PCOMPARE utility reports differences between two input files.            
One file is designated as OLD, the other as NEW.  PCOMPARE, therefore,          
tells what happened to the OLD file to produce the NEW file.  "What             
happened" is some combination of deleted records and inserted records.          
A "change" to a record is noted as a delete/insert combination.                 
                                                                                
   Input files can be members of PAN libraries, sequential TSO data sets        
(of fixed or variable length format, not unformatted), or members               
of partitioned TSO data sets.  You can mix and match OLD and NEW files          
of any of these types.                                                          
                                                                                
   PCOMPARE has the ability to produce a few kinds of output, but the           
one that is the most useful is called a DELTA report.  This is a report         
showing only the records which differ between the OLD and NEW files.            
There is also a DETAIL report, which shows ALL of the records of both           
files, whether they have changed or not (this is not of much use to us).        
                                                                                
   The third type of output is called an UPDATE file (and optional              
report).  This file contains a ++UPDATE input stream to be used as input        
to PAN#1.  It contains the commands necessary to change the OLD file            
into the NEW file.  By selectively editing the UPDATE file, you can             
produce an "in between" version of the OLD and NEW files.  Like the             
DETAIL report, this has been judged to be of little value, and its              
features have been neither tested nor documented.                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
FILES AND COMMANDS

   In the JCL to execute PCOMPARE, you must define the following                
DDNAMEs:

         The data set in which PCOMPARE lives (in U.S., PAN.PANVALET).

         The data set containing the OLD file.  This can be a PAN               
         library or a sequential data set.  In the latter case, you can         
         also specify a member of a partitioned data set.

         The data set containing the NEW file.  This can be the same as         
         PCOLD.

         A temporary work data set.  This must be large enough to hold          
         all the records read from PCOLD.  It must be a disk file.  The         
         blocksize is a full track multiple of the PCOLD LRECL.

         The PCOMPARE command input stream.                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
   The SYSIN input stream is a series of commands to PCOMPARE.  There           
are only four commands:  COMPARE, OLD, NEW, and UPDATE.  Each command           
takes a series of optional keyword operands.  For those operands                
marked with an asterisk, defaults for the NEW command are taken from the        
corresponding operand on the OLD command, and vice versa.  The command          
syntax is                                                                       
                                                                                
           COMMAND KEYWORD1(ARG) KEYWORD2(ARG) . . .etc.                        
                                                                                
Here is a command summary:                                                      
                                                                                
      COMPARE                                                                   
         This must be the first command in the input stream.  All of            
         its operands are optional, but for our purposes this command           
         should always appear as

         which will put 60 lines on a page (rather than the default of          
         56), and will suppress the creation of an UPDATE file.

         This defines the OLD input file.  It is an optional command,           
         but will almost always be needed.  All of its operands are             
         optional.  These are the relevant operands:

               Defaults to PANVALET.  This requires that you specify            
               the PAN member with the MEMBER operand to be described.          
               If you specify SEQUENTIAL, then PCOLD can be either a

               be compared.

               Specifies the columns to be compared.  This defaults to          
               columns 1 through the logical record length.  For PAN            
               books of language BAL, the default columns are (1 72).

   One of the most common uses of this utility is to simply compare two         
members of the same PAN library.  Suppose you suddenly find a bug in            
MYPROG, and you have saved a previous version in MYPROGX.  You would            
then compare these two PAN members, specifying MYPROGX as the OLD file,         
and MYPROG as the NEW file.  Sample JCL follows:

   Another fun use of PCOMPARE is to compare a PAN member to a member of        
a TSO partitioned data set.  Suppose the U.K. transmits a new version of        
GEGENCON to the U.S., and it is placed in MYID.DDS.JCL(XMIT).  Since            
both countries may have made changes to GEGENCON simultaneously, and the        
level numbers may be of dubious informational value, you may now wish to        
see the differences so that you can merge the two books.  So you wish to        
compare GEGENCON (OLD) to MYID.DDS.JCL(XMIT) (NEW).  Sample JCL follows:

OLD FILEORG(PANVALET) MEMBER(GEGENCON)                                          
NEW FILEORG(SEQUENTIAL) COLUMN(1 72)                                            
/*                                                                              
//                                                                              
                                                                                
In this example, both FILEORG operands are required because one of the          
input files is not of type PAN, and if only one operand is supplied, the        
other will automatically be assumed to be the same.  The COLUMN operand         
is also required because otherwise, the default columns for the PAN             
member (1 72) will conflict with the columns for the TSO member (the            
LRECL:  (1 80)).  This way, both OLD and NEW compare columns are forced         
to (1 72).
