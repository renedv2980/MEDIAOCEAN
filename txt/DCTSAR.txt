           TSAR maintains a set of records in key sequence using one or         
           more core buffers and one or more TEMPSTR pages. Records may         
           be fixed or variable length. For variable length records the         
           first 2 bytes of the record contains the total record length         
           followed by the key. When the core buffer becomes full it is         
           paged out to TEMPSTR, when all TEMPSTR pages have become full        
           end of file is returned. For some actions a record may be            
           addressed by it's relative number (base 1), which is returned        
           in TSARD for all update/read type actions (beware of using           
           this when adding, as relative record numbers change). Cross          
           transaction processing is supported via maintenance actions          
           which are described below. Before calling TSAR point R1 to           
           TSARD, no other parameters are required. The following fields        
           must be set in TSARD for all actions -

           TSAINI - To initialise TSAR, this must be the first call to          
                    the module. The following fields must be set for            
                    this action -

           TSASAV - To save buffer information and page out any pending         
                    pages to TEMPSTR. This should be used for cross             
                    transaction processing before exiting.                      
                                                                                
           TSARES - To restore buffer information for cross transaction         
                    processing. This action should be used instead of           
                    TSAINI. The following fields must be set for this           
                    action -

           TSAADD - To add a record to the buffer. If buffer becomes            
                    full TSEEOF is set in TSERRS. If the key already

                    does not exist TSERNF is set in TSERRS.                     
                                                                                
           TSAPUT - To put a record by number to the buffer. If the             
                    record does not exist TSERNF is set in TSERRS. Set          
                    TSRNUM to the required record number to be put.             
                                                                                
           TSADEL - To delete a record by either it's key or number. If         
                    TSRNUM is binary zeroes the key of the record is            
                    used. If the record does not exist TSERRS is set            
                    to TSERNF.

           TSARDH - To read high for record key. The record with either         
                    the requested key or the next record in the buffer          
                    is returned unless TSEEOF (end of file) is set. If          
                    exact key is not found TSERRS is set to TSERNF.             
                                                                                
           TSAGET - To get a record by it's number. If the record is not        
                    found TSERRS is set to TSERNF.                              
                                                                                
           TSANXT - To get next record in buffer. This action may follow        
                    TSARDH, TSAGET or TSANXT. TSERRS is set to TSEEOF           
                    and TSEEOF at end of file.                                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
After TSAR: Condition code is EQUAL if action OK, NOT EQUAL if not.             
            Error condition is set in TSERRS.
