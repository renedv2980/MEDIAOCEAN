         TITLE 'MPQVERT'                                                        
                                                                                
  MPQVERT inverts a survey questionnaire file from respondent sequence          
to question and answer sequence. (Questionnaire invert = QVERT.)                
                                                                                
INPUT FILE                                                                      
----------                                                                      
                                                                                
    DDNAME= QVIN.  A survey questionnaire file in column-binary format.         
  Block and record sizes set by MPQVERT control cards.                          
                                                                                
    Errors can occur on the input file such as incomplete respondent            
 card sets, invalid card numbers, and invalid numeric fields. These             
 can be optionally listed, but do not cause the job to abend.                   
                                                                                
    However, it is imperative that the respondent count be specified            
 correctly in the control cards. If not, the job will abend with a code         
 of 999.

    DDNAME= QVOUT.  Output is a file suitable for input to the MPQFILE          
  load. Block size and maximum record size are set by MPQVERT control           
  cards. See QVTRECD in pan book MPGENQS for record dsect.                      
                                                                                
   Answer records are bit vectors or arithmetic value vectors.  MPQVERT         
 performs a compression on all answer records which normally results in         
 dramatic file space savings.

    MPQVERT uses COVAIL to acquire all available storage.                       
                                                                                
    Because all respondents must be processed before a single answer            
  record can be completed and there is not generally enough storage to          
  hold all the inverted records, MPQVERT requires internal work files.          
  It uses SORTER for this purpose. The set of respondents processed             
  before the core tables are flushed to the sort is a 'gulp'.

   Control cards are read from SYSIN and are terminated by a /*.                
 Any card with an * in column 1 is printed but otherwise ignored.               
                                                                                
   Controls are defined in KEYWORD= format and can be entered one               
 or several to a card.

   ACCESS=NNN cards can be interspersed throughout the CCP spec                 
 cards to specify access section numbers. They remain in effect                 
 until another access card is encountered. ACCESS=0 is acceptable.

  MPQVERT lists all control cards and specification cards.                      
                                                                                
  It also provides a report with such information as spec counts,               
input file record counts, output file record and byte counts, the               
size and number of 'gulps', etc.                                                
                                                                                
  The PRINTCCP option causes a list of all the punches and numeric              
fields processed with a count or sum for each and a count of the                
number of responses which the program was able to compress.
