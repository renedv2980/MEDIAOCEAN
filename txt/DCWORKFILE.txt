The use of work files is very helpful in many programming situations and is     
easily handled if the following guidelines are followed -                       
                                                                                
         LA    R8,DTFNAME         (In the examples it is assumed                
         LA    R9,IOAREA          that R8 points to the DTF and                 
         OPENR (R8)               that R9 points to the IO area.)               
                                                                                
         WRITE (R8),SQ,(R9)       Write a file out to disk.                     
         CHECK (R8)                                                             
                                                                                
         MVC   IOAREA(2),=C'/*'   Write your own EOF marker which               
         WRITE (R8),SQ,(R9)       can be tested on subsequent read.             
         CHECK (R8)               Do not close the file.                        
                                                                                
         POINTS (R8)              Reposition file for reading                   
         CHECK  (R8)              or for reading the same file again.           
                                                                                
         READ  (R8),SQ,(R9)       Read the file sequentially                    
         CHECK (R8)

         WRITE (R8),UPDATE,(R9)   Optional update of changed record.            
         CHECK (R8)
