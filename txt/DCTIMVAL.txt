         TITLE 'TIMVAL'                                                         
Validates a variable-length time expression and converts into a special four    
byte expression described below.                                                
                                                                                
NOTE: There are *TWO* versions of source code for TIMVAL:                       
        DDTIMVAL  (generates a core-resident phase)                             
        DDTIMVALR (generates a relocatable)                                     
      See the tombstone at the top of either module for details.

 Valid Expressions                                                              
 -----------------                                                              
                                                                                
Times can be 1-4 byte        1-byte hour (example 7 9)                          
                             2-byte hour (example 10  12)                       
                             3-byte hour & minutes (example 700 930)            
                             4-byte hour & minutes (example 0900 1143)          
                                                                                
Times are followed by A(am) or P(pm) code.                                      
12 or 1200 is followed by N(noon) or M(midnight).                               
A range of times is two times separated by a -.                                 
When the first code is the same as the second it may be omitted.                
The special words NONE and VAR (or VARY) are allowed (in the core-resident      
  version *only*).

 Output Expression (4-bytes)                                                    
 ---------------------------                                                    
                                                                                
Two 2-byte binary fields expressing military times:                             
thus 1230P=1230 145P=1345 9P=2100 1201A=0001.                                   
                                                                                
Each two-byte field (whether start or end time) contains the military           
time in minutes, represented in hex.                                            
                                                                                
In the case of a single time expression, the second 2-bytes is zero.            
NONE returns a value f C'NONE'.                                                 
VAR or VARY returns a value of C'VARY'.                                         
                                                                                
The on-line, core-resident version (DDTIMVAL) is T00A0E.                        
The relocatable version (DDTIMVALR) is RMTIMVAL.
