         TITLE 'DOWNLOADING RULES'                                              
You can communicate with the downloading software by sending special            
format reports to the print queue which will then be 'DIP'ed by the             
down-loading software and transmitted to PC files in format that is             
compatible with BASIC or LOTUS 123 etc.                                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
The following rules should be followed:-                                        
                                                                                
1.  First page of report should be details of request.                          
2.  Rest of data should start (and end) on page 2.                              
3.  Send headings (but not the rest of the headlines) once at the               
       beginning of the report.                                                 
4.  Numeric fields contain only digits, minus sign and decimal point.           
5.  All other fields must be surrounded by double quotes.                       
6.  Fields must be seperated by at least one space.                             
7.  Transmit zero fields as 0 and blank as " ". Do not ignore.                  
8.  Do not send double quotes in fields.  Change to single.                     
9.  Use only the first 72 characters of the print line.  Continue at the        
    beginning of next or subsequent lines.  Do not 'wrap-around'.               
10. End each logical line (which may be several lines on the print              
    queue) with a ; after a space.                                              
11. End the whole report with a :.
