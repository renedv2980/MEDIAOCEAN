         TITLE 'DEMAND (US)'                                                    
Module provides a logical interface to aid in reading records from the          
demographic files.                                                              
                                                                                
Parameter 1                  A(DBLOCK)                                          
Parameter 2                  A(output hook) or 0                                
Parameter 3                  C'*IO*' This parameter is not required for         
                                     normal DEMAND calls.                       
Parameter 4                  A(users IO trace routine if P3=*IO*)               
                                                                                
The range of records to be read, the file and A(output) are all specified in    
DBLOCK.  DEMAND will also extract selected data from the actual record read and 
format into DBLOCK.

Specify the following additional fields:                                        
                                                                                
        DBFUNCT     = DBGETDEM                                                  
        DBSELDAY                                                                
        DBSELTIM                                                                
                                                                                
    If DBSELDAY = 0, DEMAND will read for MON-SUN as a default.  Similarily, if 
DSBELTIM = 0, DEMAND will default to 6A-545A.                                   
    Criteria for selection of a demo record is any overlap with the day/time.   
Thus if DBSELDAY=MON-FRI, then a Monday record could be chosen since it overlaps
the slected days. After DEMAND returns control to the user, DBFACTOR will       
reflect the product of the number of days of overlap and the quarter hour       
overlap of the record with DBSELTIM. Records for "various" days and records with
a duration of less than two quarter hours will be excluded.                     
    To read for a time period record using a pure number, complete DBSELPUR.    
When the user regains control, test DBFACTOR = 0 to see if a record was found   
(zero=not found, non-zero=found). A non-zero DBFACTOR is the product of the     
number of days the record represents and the quarter hour overlap.              
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                 File Sequence - Time Period Data                               
                 --------------------------------                               
                                                                                
    For a given day and start time, records will be sequenced with the highest  
duration field first. In the case of a tie, records will appear in the same     
order as the NTI tape. As a default, DEMAND takes the first "qualified" record. 
To force DEMAND to return all "qualified" records, set DBBEST=A.

    HUT records can be read by setting DBSELSTA=HUT T. Only individual day HUT  
records will be read. Thus if DBSELDAY=MON-FRI, for example, only a MON, TUE,   
WED, THU, or FRI record will be returned and not a MON-FRI even though it may   
overlap the selected time period.

                      ------------                                              
    To read program data, set DBFUNCT =DBGETNTI. This function allows the user  
to read for a single program, programs that start within a given day/time       
period, or all programs for a network/book.                                     
                                                                                
    A. For a single program,set DBSELPRG = NTI progam number. After DEMAND,     
       DBFACTOR = 0 if program was not found.                                   
                                                                                
    B. To filter for day/time, complete DBSELDAY and DBSELTIM and provide the   
       address of a user hook in the DEMAND call. DEMAND will blow up if the    
       user hook address is not provided.                                       
                                                                                
       Only programs starting in the selected time period can be returned.      
       Programs will be returned in time within day order. Overlap of the       
       program's day with DBSELDAY will be the default selection criteria.      
       However, if the user sets DBEST = L, then programs will only be returned 
       if they exactly match on day. This switch setting can be used to read    
       only MON-FRI rotations and filter out individual day programs that run in
       the MON-FRI range.                                                       
                                                                                
       To read all programs for a network book in day/time order, set DBSELDAY =
       MON-SUN and DBSELTIM = 6A-545A.                                          
                                                                                
       DEMAND excludes "various" day programs and programs of 15 minutes or     
       less.                                                                    
                                                                                
    C. To read all programs for a network book in NTI program number order, set 
       DBSELPRG=DBSELDAY=DBSELTIM=0. No records are filtered out under these    
       conditions.                                                              
                                                                                
    D. For all the above reads DBFACTOR will contian the quarter hour overlap   
       after DEMAND.

       Season-to-date data will be read if DBSELSTA+3=S.

       When reading program data across many network/books, physical IO can be  
       substantially reduced by providing an optimization area to DEMAND where  
       it can save the disk address of program data for each network/book. The  
       optimization code uses 11 byte entries. Set DBAOPT to the address of your
       optimization area and dblopt to the length of the area.                  
           *****************************************************************    
           * Before calling DEMAND for the first time, clear the first two *    
           * two bytes of the area. Demand uses the first two bytes for    *    
           * the length of the area used so far.                           *
