         TITLE 'FOUT'                                                           
Macro sets an indicator in a TWA header that a field is to be transmitted and   
optionally moves data into the field.                                           
                                                                                
(Name)   FOUT  header(,data,length)                                             
                                                                                
Header must be the address of a TWA field header. (Be careful not to specify the
field itself as this produces dire results.) This can be in a register (Rn) or  
can be the name of the header.                                                  
                                                                                
Data is an optional parameter specifying the address of data to be moved into   
the nominated header+8.  This can be a register (Rn), the name of a C type data 
constant or a literal (C'...' or CLn'....').                                    
                                                                                
Length of data to be moved should also be specified (the default value is the   
length of the data not the length of the field).  This can be expressed as a    
register containing the length (Rn) or as an integer.                           
                                                                                
Note that FOUT uses equated indicators so you must ++INCLUDE DDFLDIND for any   
module using FOUT.
