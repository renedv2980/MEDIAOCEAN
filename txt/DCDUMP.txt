 NOTES:

      If param 2 is 'T' (i.e. the TWA feature), SCAN in param 2 will cause the  
 TWA to be searched for error conditions. The first error header found will be  
 displayed. If no errors are found the 'END OF TWA' message will be displayed   
                                                                                
      TWA headers (param 2 = T) will be preceded by the core address AND the TWA
 displacement of the header, in that order, followed by the screen position     
 (row=nn,col=nn) and keywords for three attributes of the field.                
                                                                                
       PROT = Field is permanently or temporarily protected.                    
       MOD  = Field is permanently or temporarily modified.                     
       CUR  = Cursor assigned to this field.                                    
                                                                                
 Absence of a keyword denotes absence of the attribute.
