OVERVIEW                                                                        
--------                                                                        
   MBDATER has two distinct sets of functions, "low level" functions            
and "high level" functions. The low level functions are used only by            
the MediaBase file maintenance program and by MBDATER itself (in its            
high level mode) and are not documented here. MBDATERD has a good               
discussion of the relationship between the two modes.                           
                                                                                
   MBDATER (in its high level mode) is one of the 'satellite' modules           
that act as an intermediary between the program needing the data and            
MBLOOK. It calls MBLOOK to find the right calendar data (properly               
qualified), processes that data, and passes it back to the caller in            
an easy to use format.                                                          
                                                                                
   To use MBDATER It is necessary to refer to MBDATERD as well as this          
document.                                                                       
                                                                                
PARAMETER LIST                                                                  
--------------                                                                  
   Like most MediaBase modules MBDATER must be called with R1 pointing          
to MBPARMS/MBBLOCK.                                                             
                                                                                
   Parm1  Byte 0       -Command byte - see below                                
          Bytes 1-3    -A(Control Block) - covered by MBDATERD                  
                                                                                
COMMANDS                                                                        
--------                                                                        
  (High level functions only)                                                   
                                                                                
  MBDMENQ   - Menu mode. Interfaces with DDMENU. The program builds             
              the menu table and handles displaying and processing              
              the entries. MNMODE in DDMENUD really controls what               
              goes on.                                                          
                                                                                
  MBDLOOKQ  - Look up data for a specific date.                                 
                                                                                
CALLER SET FIELDS IN MBDATERD                                                   
-----------------------------                                                   
  (High level functions only)                                                   
                                                                                
  Fields that might require some explanation are:                               
                                                                                
  1) MBDSQN - Sequence number. If there are multiple issues for the             
       same date, use this field to identify which one is required.             
       This is of limited use because it is only in a menu type                 
       environment, where a specific selection has been made that one           
       would generally know which issue for a given date is required.           
       This field should normally be left null.                                 
                                                                                
       If multiple issues on the same date prove to be common something         
       will have to be done to ensure the retrieval of data for the             
       correct issue.                                                           
                                                                                
  2) MBDSTISS and MBDENISS - start and ending issue numbers. These              
       will be used when and if we do lookups based on issue number.            
       They are not used currently.                                             
                                                                                
  3) MBDAQUAL - Address of a qualifier string in MediaBase internal             
       format. May be nulls.                                                    
                                                                                
  4) MBDAFQS - Address of a "fixed qualifier" block (covered by MBLFQD          
       in MBLOOKD). Can be used instead of or in addition to MBLAQUAL.          
       May be nulls.                                                            
                                                                                
  5) MBDBSDTP - Base date (cover or issue). Leave nulls and it will             
       default to the right type for the database.                              
                                                                                
FIELDS RETURNED BY MBDATER                                                      
--------------------------                                                      
                                                                                
     For MBDLOOKQ and MBDMENQ (in process entry mode) details about             
     the specified date are returned at MBDCNTL in the "low level"              
     section of MBDATERD. Data for up to 8 date types associated with           
     the base date is returned in the repeating fields starting at              
     MBDODATA. You can use the date type IC (internal code) as an               
     index to the date type you are interested in. Copy date, for               
     example is always in the 3rd slot (MBQDTCPY = 3). The date types           
     are as follows:                                                            
                                                                                
        1) MBQDTCOV  Cover date.

        3) MBQDTCPY  Copy date.                                                 
        4) MBQDTCAN  Cancel date.                                               
        5) MBQDTORD  Order date.                                                
        6) MBQDTINV  Invoice date.                                              
        7) MBQDTAIR  Air date (broadcast only).
