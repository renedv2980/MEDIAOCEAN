         TITLE 'ADDAY'                                                          
Computes a second date from a first date and a relative number of days          
months, or years, plus/minus.                                                   
                                                                                
Parm1  CL1  C'D'=Days, C'M'=Months,C'Y'=Years (Default C'D'=Days)               
       AL3  A(Input date C'YYMMDD')                                             
                                                                                
Parm2  XL1  X'80'=Always set output day to last day in month (M/Y only)         
            X'40'=Dont set output day to last if input day is last              
            X'20'=Dont output DDS YR2000 dates                                  
       AL3  A(Output date C'YYMMDD')                                            
                                                                                
Parm3  XL4  Signed full word with number of days, months, or years              
                                                                                
If C'Y' is set in P1(1) ADDAY will take the number of YEARS specified in        
P3 (signed integer) and return a new output date. If C'M' is set in             
P1(1) ADDAY will take the number of MONTHS specifies as a signed integer        
in P3 and return a new output date.                                             
For both C'Y' and C'M' it is possible that the input day number will be         
wrong for the output month eg JUN31. In the case where an input day             
is higher than the maximum day in the output month, ADDAY will set the          
output day to the maximum for the output month. For example MAY31 plus          
one month will always return JUN30. If the input day is the last day of         
the month then the output day will be set to the last day of the output         
month. For example APR30 plus one month will return MAY31. If you do not        
want ADDAY to adjust to the last day of the month, then set on X'40' bit        
in P2(1). In this case APR30 minus one month will return MAR30. Note            
that FEB28 in a leap year is not considered to be the last day of the           
month. If you always want the output day to be set to the last day of           
the output month, then set P2(1)=X'80'.                                         
                                                                                
Any other value in P1(1), or specifically  C'D', will cause the number          
of DAYS specified in the signed full word in P3 to be applied to the            
input date. This is an exact calculation of the output date based on            
the number of days passed. No end of month adjustments apply.                   
                                                                                
The input and output dates default to the standard DDS year 2000 formats        
where the first year byte has a non valid EBCDIC chr (Eg 1999 is X'F9F9'        
and 2000 is X'FAF0'). However, to aid conversion an input year in the           
range C'00' thru C'27' will be assumed to be 2000 thru 2027.                    
                                                                                
If you want ADDAY to output valid EBCDIC dates (rather than the DDS             
standard internal) for 2000+ dates then set on X'20' bit in P2(1).              
                                                                                
If you want to set the date to the last day of the month, call ADDAY to         
add zero years to the input date, requesting end of month adjustment.           
This may sound like a trivial call, but it will handle leap years and           
any non standard internal dates used for YR2000 compliance.
