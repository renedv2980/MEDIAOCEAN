         TITLE 'BUFFALO'                                                        
Module will maintain elastic accumulators in a defined sequence. Each line of   
accumulators consists of up to 10 key fields followed by the accumulators which 
are defined as a 2-dimensional row*column pattern.  Accumulators may be full-   
word binary or 8-byte packed.                                                   
                                                                                
User specifies the maximum number of lines to be maintained in core. But this is
only a guide.  When the number of lines is exceeded, BUFFALO will roll the lines
out to disk or merge with previous lines. Although performance will deteriorate 
if disk is used heavily, the process will be transparent to the user.           
                                                                                
User needs a CSECT containing BUFFALO control values and core storage for core- 
resident lines.  This can be generated using the BUFF macro and covered by a    
DSECT called BUFFALOD (++INCLUDE DDBUFFALOD). The generated CSECT is called     
BUFFALOC.

                                  fields may be changed before reset, so that   
                                  another application can be supported.         
 Notes on BUFFALO                                                               
 ----------------                                                               
                                                                                
When you PUT a record to BUFFALO, you must address a record that starts with key
as specified in BUFF and continues with 1 row of accumulators. The other rows   
will be pre-cleared for you.                                                    
                                                                                
When you GET a record from BUFFALO (or HIGH or SEQ) you will be passed back the 
key followed by the row of accumulators specified by the ,row parameter.  If you
specify row 0 (,0) you will get the key followed by every row of accumulators.  
When you get a record sequentially (SEQ), the key of the record you get is      
compared against the previous record.  (It is assumed that your third parameter 
is still pointing to this.)  BUFFALO will detect the level of control break, and
this will be returned to you in BUFFCB.  BUFFUSER will contain the code that you
associated with that level of break when you set up your keylist in BUFF.       
                                                                                
The buffer space (BUFFAREA) at the end of the CSECT should not be referenced    
directly.  As a matter of interest, the first r bytes are used as a logical     
record area and the remaining l*r bytes constitute the core buffer where        
r=record length and l=lines.                                                    
                                                                                
You can filter on a particular record type by making the first byte of Parameter
2 non zero.  This will be compared against the first byte of a BUFFALO key.     
Applies to SEQ, ADD, CLEAR.
