ALL ONLINE TRANSACTIONS ARE MONITORED AS THEY PASS THROUGH THE ADPAK SYSTEM.    
VARIOUS VALUES THAT REFLECT THE USAGE OF THE SYSTEM RESOURCES ARE COLLECTED INTO
A DATA RECORD FOR EACH TRANSACTION WHICH IS ADDED TO THE ADPAK DATA RECORDER    
FILE (ADRFILE). THE VALUES THAT ARE RECORDED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING :-

AT THE END OF EACH DAY THE ADRFILE IS SORTED AND PROCESSED TO GIVE THE MEAN     
VALUES FOR ALL TRANSACTIONS FOR EACH TERMINAL AND EACH PROGRAM. THE DAILY VALUES
ARE THEN WRITTEN TO THE ADPAK STATISTICS FILE (STATS). THE DAILY VALUES ARE ALSO
INTEGRATED INTO A SET OF CUMULATIVE VALUES MAINTAINED IN THE STATS FILE. THUS   
THE STATS FILE CONTAINS A RECORD FOR EACH TERMINAL AND PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES   
THE FOLLOWING :-

TWO BASIC REPORT PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE PRINTING OF INFORMATION         
CONTAINED IN THE STATS FILE. THE PROGRAM STATREPT PRODUCES A LISTING OF ALL     
FIELD VALUES FOR TERMINALS AND/OR PROGRAMS FOR A DAILY AND/OR CUMULATIVE PERIOD.
THE PROGRAM STATHOUR PRODUCES A LISTING OF A NOMINATED FIELD VALUE (EG. AVERAGE 
CPU TIME) BROKEN DOWN INTO HOURLY PERIODS FOR TERMINALS AND/OR PROGRAMS FOR A   
DAILY AND/OR CUMULATIVE PERIOD.                                                 
         TITLE 'STATMAKE - CREATION OF THE STATISTICS FILE'                     
THE PROGRAM STATMAKE IS USED TO INITIALISE THE STATISTICS FILE (STATS). THE FILE
IS DEFINED BY A SET OF PARAMETER CARDS WHICH GIVE THE SIZE OF THE FILE AND THE

THE ORDER OF THESE CARDS DEFINES THE LISTING ORDER FOR PROGRAM ORIENTED REPORTS.
THE NUMBER OF CARDS MUST NOT EXCEED THE VALUE SPECIFIED IN THE SIZE CARD.       
FOR A GIVEN SYSTEM IF IT IS DESIRED TO NOMINATE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND TO GROUP  
ALL OTHER PROGRAMS INTO ONE ENTRY THIS CAN BY DONE BY SPECIFYING A PROGRAM      
NUMBER OF 00 AND A SUITABLE PROGRAM NAME (EG OTHERS). IF A GIVEN SYSTEM DOES    
NOT INCLUDE A PROGRAM NUMBER 00 CARD THEN PROGRAMS OTHER THAN THOSE ACTUALLY    
NOMINATED WILL BE IGNORED.
