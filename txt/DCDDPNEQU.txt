A) Introduction                                                                 
---------------                                                                 
                                                                                
     DDPNEQU is an offline utility which produces and catalogues Data           
Dictionary equate books in the PAN library.  It reads the Data Dictionary       
records in GENDIR/GENFIL and picks out all the EQUnames, along with the         
message numbers and dictionary text associated with them, and creates           
a PANVALET book in an assembler language format.  The equate statements,        
which consists of the EQUname, the 'EQU' instruction, the message number        
of the EQUname, and the dictionary text used as a comment, are placed in        
alphabetical order by the comments.                                             
                                                                                
     The program is run by submitting JCL catalogued procedure DDEQU            
and run options are controlled by the following card data input lines.          
                                                                                
B) JCL CARD DATA INPUT.

         Default character is 'A' in the US, and ' ' in UK.                     
     Note: Without the TEST= card in the UK, a live version of the              
            PAN book will be produced, overwriting the live book.

     report for equate book created, any additional information as              
     requested by control input,(see (B) above,) and report of any              
     catalogue steps that occurred.

     Also a test character may be appended to the name (see (B) above.)
