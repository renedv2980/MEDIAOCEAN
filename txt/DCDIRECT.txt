The DIRECT=card is read and decoded by the master controller V(MASTER)          
The various fields are placed into an 80 chr area V(REMOTEC) which is           
an entry point within V(PRINT). Defining DSECT is in pan book DDRENMOTED        
                                                                                
The nonzero values in V(REMOTEC) will cause V(PRINT) to intercept print         
lines destined for SYSPRINT and write them to a report in the print             
queue. The report attributes are assigned from values in V(REMOTEC).
