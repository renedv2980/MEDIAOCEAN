Module provides an interface between application and WORKER.                    
Parameters are set up in WINTBLK (include ACWINTBLK)                            
Calls to WINTER are in the format:

WIPRGIND  - Program indicator, eg. WIPILINK - ledger in key

WIBINSIZ  - Size of BINSRCH buffer in K.  Compulsory if WIABIN set              
WIACTIND  - ACTION indicator. eg. WIAININI - for internal use, to               
            indicate not yet initialised, so INIT call is only done             
            once, eg. at first REQFRST

Call WINTER with action PUT for each record to go to Worker.  WINTER            
builds a Worker key and opens the Worker file on first put.  For each           
put call, the record addressed by WIAREC is added to the Worker file.           
TRNSBTCH, if spaces, is filled with current MOS.
