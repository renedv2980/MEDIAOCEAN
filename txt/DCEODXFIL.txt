REQXFIL program                                                                 
---------------                                                                 
The REQXFIL program combines the fuctions of REQPEEL,REQSORT,and REQWRAP        
in that it reads cross file requests from the control system,and creates        
a set of JCL for the nights cross file reporting. The jobs and requests         
are not stored in EODJOBS and EODREQS files, so REQXFIL is completely           
independend from the other EOD programs.                                        
                                                                                
When the REQXFIL program is run, and it finds an xfile group of requests        
that is due to be run today (see TODAY= param card),it will generate one        
job per group, with as many steps as there are individual requests in           
the group, together with one PQ report which will be used to take the           
output from the job when it is run.                                             
                                                                                
What is unique about xfile requests is that all the output goes to one          
PQ report that is created at the same time the JCL is created. Each job         
step has a special DIRECT= card that causes the first job step to place         
its output in the special XFI pq report nominated. Subsequent job steps         
append their output to the special XFI PQ report dropping the "details          
of request" heading page so that the final report on the PQ will have           
one request detail page (that of the first request in the group)                
followed by the output of each job step.                                        
                                                                                
Hence each xfile group that is due to run today will be a seperate job          
containing an EXEC of a system controller for each request. Multiple            
systems will usually be involved, and to ensure that the job remains            
read only REQXFIL will generate a WRITE=NO param card in each step.             
                                                                                
PQ report attributes                                                            
--------------------                                                            
Each xfile group due to run today will cause a single report on the PQ          
to be created. The FIRST job step with have a DIRECT=card as below.             
Each report will be class X, downloadable, with the report id XFI. The          
retain values are 21 hours live and 13 hours dead. The hhhh below is the        
report number (in hex) that has been created by REQXFIL reserved for the        
direct output from this job step. The xxxxxxxx is the name of the xfile         
group that generated this report. The 0000 just before ,XF= below tells         
the PQ software to overwrite the report identified by ID=...                    
                                                                                
DIRECT=XFI,    ,00017,Q,D  , ,N, ,ID=0011E7C6C9hhhh0000,XF=xxxxxxxx             
                                                                                
The SECOND and subsequent job steps will have a DIRECT= identical to            
that in the first job step except that there is 0001 before the ,XF=            
parameter as shown below. The 0001 tells the PQ software to append the          
output from this job step to the end of the rport defined by ID=.

The model JCL for each request is read from the PAN library and is              
wrapped around each request. Each XFILE group that is defined to run            
today,or by the date in the TODAY=date card, is created as a job with           
a set of job cards as shown below. Each job generated will have an X in         
the 5th chr of the job name (system value) and the last three chrs will         
be the job sequence number. The values on the job cards can be changed          
from their default values shown below by parm cards as defined above.
