Each advertising agency has its own strategy for handling media campaigns, but 
every agency also has one goal in common -- to make execution as smooth and    
efficient as possible.  In the case of Print campaigns this can mean producing 
and keeping track of hundreds or even thousands of documents.  Information has 
to be consistent, up-to-date, and available to different people, in different  
places, at the same time.  Accuracy is essential; delays cost money.

PRINTPAK is a computer system designed to support the "back office" aspects of 
Print media campaigns.  Developed by Donovan Data Systems in cooperation with  
major advertising agencies, the system is used by agencies throughout the US   
and Canada.  

PRINTPAK comes as a fully supported service.  Support includes hardware,       
software, training, installation, consultation on workflow, comprehensive      
documentation, and on-going contact with DDS representatives in person and by  
phone.  DDS is developing the system continually as industry needs change, and 
keeps agency personnel up to date with workshops, training, manuals, service   
bulletins, and personal consultation.

The PRINTPAK system is built around the basic functions that an advertising    
agency performs in a print media campaign.  Specific functions include         
establishing budgets, issuing contracts, issuing space reservations and        
insertion orders, monitoring volume and rate levels, issuing client invoices,  
and issuing payments to publications.  

The system keeps records, produces campaign documents, and provides a          
centralized file of agency print activity for Media, Traffic, and Client       
Accounting departments.  The information in the file is used to generate       
reports for internal use and for presentation to clients.  The system supports 
up to five separate media--Newspapers, Magazines, Trade, Supplements, and      
Outdoor.

Computer terminals in the agency's office are connected by dedicated telephone 
line to the DDS computer center in New York.  Agency personnel have direct     
control of the agency's data.  The online environment keeps data-entry errors  
to a minimum, because the system checks input before accepting it.

Anyone with an authorized terminal has instant access to media and financial   
status.  (Individual terminals can be locked out of sensitive data, and        
Passwords can be set up to limit access to confidential material, if desired.) 
Printed reports provide working documents for Media, Traffic, and Client

into PRINTPAK can be passed on to other systems and used again without being   
reentered.  

In short, PRINTPAK provides coordination and control of Print media activity.  
It is a proven, established system.  And it is backed by DDS commitment and    
expertise, so you can be sure it will continue to meet industry needs.

         TITLE 'Printpak Workflow'                                              
The preceding pages provide an overview of PRINTPAK's features and advantages. 
This section goes into more detail about how the system is used.  There are    
three major stages of activity: (1) setting up "start-up" records, (2) entering
Print transactions, and (3) requesting PRINTPAK campaign documents and analysis
reports.                                                                       
         HEAD0 'Setting Up Start-up Records'                                    
Before using the system, the agency sets up several types of information about 
agency Print buying.  Records are set up for Publications, Publication Reps,   
Clients, Products, and Standard Comment text.   Optional records can be set up 
for reporting by Districts, Regions, and Divisions, and for "list" buying.     
Each of these is described in more detail below.                               
         SPACE 2                                                                
1.Rep records.  The Repfile contains numbered records containing Rep names,   
addresses, and "attention of" notations.  Rep numbers may be used on the      
Pub record, below, to assign reps to specific publications so reps can        
receive contracts, checks, and/or insertion orders.  Each Rep record must     
be assigned to a specific media.                                              
         SPACE 1                                                                
2.Pub records.  DDS supplies a standard file of publications when the system  
is installed.  This can be modified as necessary for agency use.  Each        
Pubfile record contains general information about a PubliËcation, including   
name, main mailing address, circulation, agency commission, cash discount,    
and rep numbers.  More specific information about contract, traffic and       
paying addresses, payable date formula, etc., can also be set up.  Each       
Pub is assigned a media code specifying whether it is a magazine,             
newspaper, trade, supplement, or outdoor vendor.                              
         EJECT                                                                  
3.Client and product records:                                                 
         SPACE 1                                                                
Client Record.  The Client Record, containing a client's name and code,       
provides the system with information on a client's buying, billing and        
reporting requirements.  It must be set up before product and estimate        
(campaign) records can be established.  Each client record is assigned to     
a specific media; if a client is buying in more than one media, a separate    
client record must be set up for each additional media.                       
         SPACE 1                                                                
Product Record.  A Product Record is set up for each of a client's            
products.  In the Product Record an agency assigns a product code and         
specifies a product billing address as well as any special billing            
requirements for the product.  Each product record is assigned to a           
specific client record.

4.Division/Region/Districts.  These records are set up by Media/Client for    
reporting purposes.  Divisions are defined as groups of Products.  Regions    
and Districts are geographical groupings of pubs, often defined by            
particular Divisions, or across all Divisions by Client.  Districts are       
usually smaller parts of a larger Region.  For magazines, a national          
publication may be pro-rated across client regions or districts.              
         SPACE 2                                                                
5.Standard Comments.  The Comment File is used to store Standard Comments to  
be printed on Contracts, Estimates, Insertion Orders, Traffic List, and       
Billing invoices.  A recommended scheme for setting up standard comËments     
and their codes is given in the chapter on Printpak comments.                 
         SPACE 2                                                                
6.Publist records.  Each Publist record contains a list of Publications, to   
allow list buying for newspapers in the Buy Program.  The Publist             
facilitates buying for all or some Publications within the list at one        
time.

The List Buying feature can ease the function of entering newspaper           
schedules into the system by allowing input of many newspapers at one         
time.  It is particularly useful if clients always place ads in the same      
group of Newspapers.                                                          
         EJECT

Once the basic records are established, print schedules can be entered, with   
any supporting information necessary to control activity and provide desired   
reports.  The following types of information are entered:                      
         SPACE 2                                                                
1.Estimates.  Each campaign or estimate is described in an Estimate Record.   
Information includes the duration of the campaign and any special billing     
or reporting requirements which differ from the client profile.               
         SPACE 1                                                                
2.Budgets (optional).  Authorized Dollars may be allocated to a specific      
Client, Product, and Estimate or even region or district.  The Authorized     
dollars can print on the Estimate summaries, if specified in the Client       
Profile.                                                                      
         SPACE 1                                                                
3.Contracts.  Contracts may be set up to establish pub rates.  The system     
can use these when each buy is entered to calculate rates.  Printed           
Contracts can be requested through the system; these can report rate          
basis, schedules, or both.                                                    
         SPACE 1                                                                
4.Ad records.  An Adfile record is used to define the caption, copy number,   
and ad size for each Ad.  This information is used by the system to print     
insertion orders.                                                             
         SPACE 1                                                                
5.Buy schedules.  For each Insertion the user specifies client, product,      
estimate, publication, date, and ad number.  The system looks up and          
inserts ad information and rates.  (Rates may also be entered directly on     
the buy.)                                                                     
         SPACE 1                                                                
6.Approving Payments.  Checks are issued in two stages.  First, each          
Publication's invoices must be "cleared" for payment.  After clearances       
are made, checks can be requested.  Before accepting a clearance, the         
system insists that the "cleared" amount be equal to the amount on order.     
If the amount on the publication invoices fails to match the amounts on       
order, the system issues a discrepancy report.  Clearances can be made for    
an individual Client, a Product, an Estimate, or an Insertion.  The           
Payer's List report (P27) can be used as a cash flow management tool to       
find out what pub invoices to expect; what is payable and when; etc.          
         SPACE 1                                                                
7.Report Requests.  Media and accounting reports, as well as vendor checks    
and client billing, are generated by user request.  In addition, various      
reports are produced automatically each day, as a printed record of           
activity.  Individual reports are described in the following section.
