         TITLE 'TWXCI'                                                          
Macro clears fields in a TWA and sets the input field length to zero.  Apart    
from setting the field input length to zero, this macro is identical to the     
TWAXC macro.                                                                    
                                                                                
         TWXCI start(,end)(,PROT=Y)(,TRNS=N)                                    
                                                                                
Start and end are the addresses of field headers in a TWA.  End is optional.    
Default is to clear to end of TWA.  Start and end can be either addresses or    
registers                                                                       
                                                                                
         PROT=Y         Will also clear protected fields (default=N)            
                                                                                
         TRNS=N         Will not turn on transmit bit in FLDHDR (default=Y)     
                                                                                
         TRNS=T         Will not clear or transmit null fields          =Y)
