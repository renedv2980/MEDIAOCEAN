         TITLE 'DEMAND (UK)'                                                    
Controls the reading of the UK DEMFILE, on- or off-line.  The caller specifies  
via a 2304 byte interface buffer (see MEDEMANDD) which kinds of records he      
requires and for which request profile, which filters are to be applied and     
which control breaks he wants signalled.  Modes, records and ancillary data are 
passed back in the same interface buffer.                                       
                                                                                
Parameter 1    byte  0       C'F'=first call                                    
                             C'S'=read sequential for next                      
                             C'H'=read high (sequence broken)                   
               bytes 1-3     A(buffer) - see MEDEMANDD for details              
                                                                                
After an error:                                                                 
                                                                                
Parameter 1    byte  0       X'FF'                                              
               bytes 1-3     A(DMCB)                                            
                                                                                
After a DATAMGR trace mode:                                                     
                                                                                
Parameter 1                  A(DMCB)                                            
                                                                                
Otherwise input parameters are returned unchanged and GDMODE in the interface   
buffer indicates what kind of event has occurred.
