         TITLE 'BUFFOON'                                                        
This module is an online version of BUFFALO.  All commands are supported.       
However, no attempt is made to write records out to disk when the core buffer   
is filled. After a PUT, when the record will not fit, Parameter 3 byte 1 will   
be set to X'80'.                                                                
                                                                                
To work out how much core will be required for a BUFF macro of L lines:-        
                                                                                
Record size (R) = key + comment + (rows x columns x 4)  binary                  
            (R) = key + comment + (rows x columns x 8)  packed                  
                                                                                
Then core required = 128 + R(L+1) bytes.                                        
                                                                                
Core-resident phase name is T00A3C.
