The SPOTPAK Overnight Research report has a flexible format that allows you to 
design your own report.  You can choose not only source, book, demos, and so   
forth, as in existing demographic reports, but you can also choose a selection 
of details which will appear on the report, such as day, rank, or station.     
Whatever "detail types" you choose  serve as column headings.  In addition, you
can enter the details in any order so as to produce a report that presents data
in whatever order of priority you need.

         HEAD2 'Detail Columns'                                                 
You can choose any combination of the following detail types to print as       
columns on the left side of the report.  (Demographics for the detail          
categories are printed in columns on the right side of the report.)

The order in which you enter your choice of details will determine the order in
which the detail columns print and consequently the order in which data appears
in the report.

For example, if you choose day and program as details, the report will show    
days (MON, TUE, etc) in the first column with programs for each day in         
alphabetical order in the second column.  On the other hand, if you choose     
program and day, the report will show programs in alphabetical order in the    
first column and the day of each program in the second column.                 
         EJECT

You can enter up to eight demo categories.  The report can show ratings,       
impressions, shares, PUTs, and totals.  Each demo category appears in a column 
on the right-hand side of the report, broken down to the level of details      
specified in the detail columns.                                               
         HEAD2 'Books'                                                          
You can request data from one or as many rating books as you have on file.  The
last five sweeps are kept on file for all markets; major markets, for which    
minor sweeps are also kept, can have as many as seven rating books.  The       
information can be grouped by book (when more than one book is used) if "book" 
is listed in the first detail column on the left.  Information will be broken  
out across books if any other categories are listed to the left of the "book"  
column.                                                                        
         HEAD2 'Averages and Totals'                                            
The report can show averages and/or totals for any of the detail columns that  
you select.

Options available on the Overnight Research report include double or triple
