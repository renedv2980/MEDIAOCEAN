To make the peel off process easier, the Peel Off Report (AC98) can now        
(1) close all jobs that are eligible for peel off, and (2) be requested in draft

When you request the AC98 to close jobs, the report name changes to the Closed 
Job Report.  It will close any jobs that have a zero balance, and have had no  
activity since the end date of the request.  The format also changes; the report
                                                                               
will list all previously closed jobs, show the closed date, and mark each job  
being closed by the report with an asterisk (*).  (If you request the report   
in draft format, it will not close jobs; but all jobs eligible for closing will
be marked with an asterisk.) Note that you can still use the MAC program and   
the individual job record for closing jobs.
