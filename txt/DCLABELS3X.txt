         TITLE 'LABELS3X'                                                       
   Essentially the same as LABELS3 except that it prints a 7 line label         
from a 7x39 array.  The user submits his or her own blank lines where           
desired.  The stationery and use logic remains the same as LABELS3 and          
the call sequence is the same.                                                  
                                                                                
   An added feature of LABELS3X is that the physical spacing is an              
option passed at the "OPEN".  If '8' is passed in the fifth parm of             
the open the labels will by spaced at 8 lines to the inch; if a '6' is          
passed in this parm the labels will be printed at 6 lines to the inch.          
The default is '6'.  Essentially this provides the ability to compress          
the printing into a smaller vertical space on each label.  The amount           
of printed lines (7) remains the same.  The physical label stationery           
remains the same, the program compensates for the different line size.          
                                                                                
   Please see LABELS3 for parm instructions.
