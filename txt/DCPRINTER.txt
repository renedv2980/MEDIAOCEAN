         TITLE 'PRINTER'                                                        
PRINTER is a general headline control and user printing facility.               
                                                                                
There is a CSECT (CPRINT) covered by a DSECT (DPRINT) described in the          
book DDDPRINT - see below - which is available to both PRINTER and the          
user through a V-type. This contains preset values which can be adjusted        
to provide a flexible repertoire of printing options.                           
                                                                                
Line 1 prints (date), (time), title, page, and (user data) - see list-and titles
are underlined on line 2.                                                       
1-4 MIDLINES may be filled with data. Non-spaces will be printed.               
1-3 SUBLINES may be filled with data. Non-spaces will be printed.               
User's print line (P) will be cleared to spaces after PRINTER.                  
                                                                                
Line and page counting is automatic.                                            
Headline printing is evoked when LINE exceeds MAXLINE.                          
Headline printing can thus be forced by ZAPing line with large number.          
                                                                                
Spacing control is handled through SPACING which is preset to single.           
Although 1-99 lines can be skipped, the recommended limit is 3.                 
(Note that SPACING is a 4-byte field which is not reset after PRINTER.)
