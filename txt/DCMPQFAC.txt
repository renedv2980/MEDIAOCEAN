         TITLE 'MPQFAC'                                                         
                                                                                
  MPQFAC is used to retrieve and manipulate bit vectors and arithmetic          
vectors from inverted survey files. All access to the surveys and all           
vector manipulation should be done using it.                                    
                                                                                
  MPQFAC offers a wide range of functions essential to magazine research        
and general cross-tabulation, but those functions pertaining only to            
cross-tabulation are not documented at this time.                               
                                                                                
  The program requires a control dsect - (++INCLUDE MPQBLKD).

                               bit vector. It is operated on normally.

                               arithmetic vector. Subsequent numeric

                            3- The QSPEC is not pre-tabbed but contains         
                               a logical statement which will be

                               which will be 'nested' within the command
