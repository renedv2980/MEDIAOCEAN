         TITLE 'MPQTRAN'                                                        
                                                                                
  MPQTRAN will translate a statement defining a logical condition               
on a survey file into an internal command string executable by MPQFAC.          
                                                                                
  A detailed description of the logical statement language can be               
found in the system user documentation.                                         
                                                                                
  MPQTRAN requires the MPQBLKD control dsect which is described in the          
MPQFAC documentation. Only MPQBNCRD and MPQBNCOL need be set. If                
MPQBNRES and MPQBSTLN are set the program will check that the statement         
is not too complex to be evaluated in the given amount of storage.              
                                                                                
  MPQTRAN only checks the statement for syntax. It does not do any file         
reading to determine if the conditions, QSPECS, or TARGETS used                 
actually exist. For this reason it is generally used in conjunction             
with MPQFAC.  In fact, it will usually be invoked only indirectly               
through MPQFAC.                                                                 
                                                                                
  The program returns an error code in MPQBERR and an English                   
explanation in MPQBEMSG generally suitable for screen display.
