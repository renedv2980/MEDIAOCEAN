REQPEEL - Read requests from input files                                        
----------------------------------------                                        
This is the first stage in the end of day cycle.                                
REQPEEL is control card driven and the cards dictate which request files        
are to be merged together for this particular cycle.

REQPEEL uses SORTWK1 and writes an output file to EODSORT (20x180=3600 blocks)

----------------------------------                                              
Run-time parameters are established for each request (or derived request).      
this determines which requests can be packaged together in a job.               
It also determines the order in which jobs will run within a system             
and the order in which requests will be processed within a job.

This is the second stage in the end of day cycle.                               
requests for all systems are passed against the control file to establish       
priority, destination, output type, sort sequence and other run-time            
parameters.                                                                     
                                                                                
Requests are then packaged into jobs of work and sorted into running sequence.  
                                                                                
Input file is SORTOUT and records are in (20x180=3600) blocks.

There are two worker output files -                                             
                                                                                
EODREQS contains the days requests.                                             
Each set of requests is preceded by a header record (see EODREQD).              
id for subfiles is 'REQS SSS' where SSS is system (see REQPEEL above)           
                                                                                
EODJOBS contains a record for each job to be run.                               
This gives number of requests, header information (EODREQD), destination logos, 
operations and packing instructions etc.                                        
Id for subfiles is 'JOBS SSS' where SSS is system.

This is the third stage of end of day cycle.                                    
streams of jobs are selected from the worker files.                             
JCL is wrapped round the requests and written directly to JES reader queue.     
the specifics are described in detail below.

Up to 100 include/exclude cards are allowed in a single spool.                  
if includes and excludes conflict, the later card has precedence.               
you can create 'and' condition include or exclude cards by combining            
conditions on the card, separated by a comma. Example:                          
INCLUDE DEST=TBNY,DISP=K                                                        
                                                                                
Control statements may come from cards (PARM=00000001) or directly              
through console (00000000). Statements in error are always displayed            
on the console for correction                                                   
                                                                                
Special JCL considerations in eod                                               
---------------------------------                                               
Prototype JCL statements need to be catalogued to the control file for          
each program referenced.                                                        
                                                                                
The id for these JCL books is sspp where SS is first two characters of          
system name and pp is program number  (example ac30 is accpak statements).      
                                                                                
It is not necessary to catalogue JES statements or MVS job, date and //         
as these get generated automatically.                                           
the exception to this is books that are referenced in BEFORE= and AFTER=        
statements by REQWRAP.                                                          
                                                                                
Conditional statements                                                          
----------------------                                                          
statements can be conditionally included in JCL streams.                        
these statements are catalogued between IF/OR and END statements.               
                                                                                
IF statements

These indicate that the JCL statements that follow are only to be               
included when the condition is satisfied. This restriction is                   
ended by an end card.

End of day produces JCL and requests to be processed by one of the off-line

to the JES print q file. While most output will then be printed locally         
on one of dds printer, JES gives operations control over those that are not.

Up to 100 include/exclude cards are allowed in a single spool.                  
if includes and excludes conflict, the later card has precedence.               
You can create 'AND' condition include or exclude cards by combining            
conditions on the card, separated by a comma. Example:
