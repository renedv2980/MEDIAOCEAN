         TITLE 'PROLLER and ROLLER'                                             
PROLLER maintains an array of 6-byte packed decimal accumulators. ROLLER main-  
tains an array of fullword binary accumulators. The dimensions and location     
of the accumulators is specified by user.                                       
                                                                                
There is an 8-byte header used by module at the beginning of the array.         
For PROLLER the array needs    (L*C*6)+8 bytes                                  
For ROLLER  the array needs    (L*C*4)+8 bytes                                  
ROLLER should be used except when accumulators may exceed 2,147,483,648.
