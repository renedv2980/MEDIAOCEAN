Single source is BBM which has three tapes available.                           
  1. Book Tapes                                                                 
      a. Time period - used for Radio tpt lookups                               
      b. Daypart - not used by DDS                                              
  2. Non-Book tapes.                                                            
      a. Daypart Summary - Used for daypart lookups.                            
We use the summary tape for the daypart info because there is no                
consistancy across stations for the data provided on the book tapes. The summary
tape has the data organized by descriptive daparts although the times are not   
the same across stations. Since there is no book value to match to we use tape  
precision to calculate demos from this file.
