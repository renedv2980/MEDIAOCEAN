         TITLE 'PANPRINT'                                                       
Program prints books directly from PANVALET library.                            
                                                                                
Assembler directive print commands (SPACE,EJECT , and TITLE) are interpreted so 
that books can be catalogued with print commands regardless of whether they are 
to be assembled or not. Documentation such as this manual can take advantage of 
this spacing control.                                                           
                                                                                
The // EXEC PANPRINT is followed by cards with book names in columns 1-10.

There are also a number of optional control cards which affect output. All these
start in column 1 with the exception of TITLE cards.

SEQUENCE=YES                 Default value                                      
SEQUENCE=NO                  Suppresses sequence & PAN data set card.           
COPIES=nn                    Up to 99 copies - default is 1.                    
INDEX=YES                    Prints an index of title/index cards               
                             with page number in alphabetic sequence            
                             and a table of contents (title/page no)            
                             in page number sequence.                           
INDEX=NO                     Default value                                      
INDEX=SEPARATE               As INDEX=YES but index prints only INDEX           
                             cards and not TITLE cards.                         
NUMBER=n                     Causes text to start on page n (1-9).              
PAGE=print                   Causes special page formatting cards to            
                             print as well as the whole page.                   
                                                                                
LINES=nn                     Maximum lines/page - default = 60.                 
DDS=NI                       Excludes cards catalogued under FILTER=DDS.        
US=NO                        Excludes cards catalogued under FILTER=US.

FILL=x                       During printing of contents and index pages,       
                             lines are padded with fill character x so that it  
                             is easier to locate page number. Recommended fill  
                             character is a period - FILL=.                     
IGNORE=ss,ee                 Don't print columns ss thru ee of data cards.      
MIDN=....midline n data....  (where n=1-4) print data after titles on mid 1-4.  
SUBN=....subline n data....  (where n=1-3) print data after midlines on sub 1-3 
                                                                                
LINEUP=80                    Causes 80 character lineup to print before job.    
LINEUP=110                   Causes 110 character lineup to print before        
                             job.                                               
                                                                                
All these controls will have effect until an overriding control. There is also a
TITLE 'headings' card which is for books that do not have an imbedded TITLE     
card.  This causes 'headings' to print at the top of each page until the next   
TITLE is encountered.

    SPACE n                  Causes n blank lines (n can be 1-9).               
    EJECT                    Causes a skip to new page.                         
    TITLE 'reference'        Causes a skip to new page and the title to print on
                             all subsequent pages until a further TITLE card is 
                             encountered. The TITLE is automatically underlined 
                             and followed by 2 blank lines. The reference appear
                             in the table of contents and in the sorted index.  
    INDEX 'reference'        Causes a reference to appear in the sorted index.  
    PRINT SINGLE             Causes single, double or triple spacing until      
    PRINT DOUBLE             another PRINT card is encountered.                 
    PRINT TRIPLE                                                                
                                                                                
(Starting in column 1)                                                          
                                                                                
  BIG=xxxxxxxx               Expands up to 8 characters into BIG letters (8x8)  
                             and prints. The first of a series of BIG cards     
                             causes skip to a new page as does the last.        
  REVERSE=mask               Causes the BIG letters to print in white against a 
                             background of the mask which can be 1-70 characters
  PAGE=START                 A whole page can be formatted at once              
  Lnn...data....             using a series of data cards between a PAGE=START

     ...                     Lnn causes 1-66 bytes of data to print on the      
     ...                      left-hand side of line nn (01-64).                
     ...                     Rnn causes 1-66 bytes of data to print on the      
  PAGE=END                    right-hand side (cols 67-132) of line nn (01-64). 
                                                                                
                             Note - Data starts in card column 4.  This allows  
                             more than 80 column printing to be supported.      
  FILTER=DDS                 The following cards will be excluded when running  
                             PANPRINT with DDS=NO control card.                 
  FILTER=UK                  As above but with UK=NO control card.              
  FILTER=US                  As above but with US=NO control card.              
  FILTER=OFF                 Ends any operative filters.                        
                             (Note - When SEQUENCE=NO is specified, the filter  
                                     cards themselves will not print.)          
                                                                                
If a book is catalogued as DATA, all 80 columns will be printed and sequence    
numbers print in cols 82-86.
