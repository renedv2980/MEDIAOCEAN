         TITLE 'LABELS3'                                                        
Most people find that sticky label formatting and printing is a general         
nuisance.  This module will remove most of the drudgery by doing all formatting 
and printing for you.                                                           
                                                                                
It is intended for labels with a distance of 1 1/2 inches between tops and      
4 1/8 inches between left edges.  (These are the standard stock currently kept  
by DDS.)  Spacing is six to the inch.                                           
                                                                                
Variable number of lineup sets are printed as are various quantities of each    
label.  For sets that are not a multiple of three no labels are wasted between  
sets.  A line is skipped between the fourth and fifth line of each label        
allowing for 'ATTN' names, etc.                                                 
                                                                                
PRINT must be included and the address passed in the "open".                    
                                                                                
To open, set quantities and print lineups:                                      
                                                                                
     GOTO1  LABELS3,DMCB,=C'$OPEN',P2,P3,P4                                     
                                                                                
       P2 = address of "PRINT"                                                  
       P3 = number of each label (FW)                                           
       P4 = number of lineup sets (FW) (Zero will suppress lineups.)            
                                                                                
To release a label:                                                             
     GOTO1  LABELS3,DMCB,P1                                                     
       P1 = address of first byte of a 5x39 line array.                         
                                                                                
To close and flush out last label(s):                                           
     GOTO1  LABELS3,DMCB,=C'$CLOSE'                                             
                                                                                
To close and flush out last label and also close the PRINT module (in           
stand alone programs):                                                          
     GOTO1  LABELS3,DMCB,=C'$CLOSP'
