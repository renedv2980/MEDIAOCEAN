     The following narrative is divided into four sections:  Editing,           
which is done under SPF; TSO commands; PF key setup; and Miscellaneous.         
Presented here are the basic commands required to use the system, as            
well as various other less commonly used, yet powerful tools.  In some          
cases suggestions are made which are just that - suggestions.  You are          
more than welcome to do things your own way, and if appropriate, to             
update this manual.  Of course, extensive help is available on any              
screen within TSO simply by pressing PF1.                                       
                                                                                
         <   > Editing under SPF                                                
                                                                                
    There are two forms of commands used under SPF:  primary commands           
and line commands.  Each is described below.                                    
                                                                                
A)  PRIMARY COMMANDS - these commands are entered on the COMMAND line           
            at the top of the screen.  They may be preceded by an "&",          
            which will cause the command to remain on the screen after          
            hitting enter.  This is especially useful when entering             
            long change commands - it makes it easy to correct typos.           
    CANCEL    - causes editing to be terminated without saving the data.        
    CAPS      - causes all data entered to be translated to upper case.         
                CAPS OFF allows for input of lower case characters.             
    C(HANGE)  - causes the data to be scanned for the specified string,         
                and then changed to 2nd specified string.                       
                a) Additional parameters are:                                   
                   ALL - change all occurrences of the string.                  
                   FIRST - change first occurrence only.*                       
                   PREV - change the first occurrence before the current line.* 
                   LAST - change the last occurrence only.*                     
                          * Note that you may use PF6 to change each            
                            of the remaining occurrences.                       
                   NX - do not include excluded lines from change. See          
                        line command "x" for excluding lines.                   
                b) Strings can be delimited by either (') or (").               
    C(OPY)    - copy from another source.  If no source is given, a             
                screen will be displayed for entering the source name.          
                Note that to copy from a PAN library, "$PAN" should             
                be the second parameter.                                        
    F(IND)    - causes the data to be scanned for the specified string.         
                a) Find * will look for string last used.                       
                b) Additional parameters are FIRST, PREV, LAST and NX.          
                   (See CHANGE command for descriptions.)                       
                c) Strings can be delimited by either (') or (").               
    HEX       - causes data to be displayed in hexadecimal format.              
    HEX OFF   - causes data to be displayed in character format.                
    L(OCATE)  - causes direct scrolling to a specified line number.             
    NULLS     - causes empty areas to be null-filled, rather than space-        
                filled.  You should use this command the first time             
                you edit a member of most data sets. (It then is permanent.)    
                It enables you to insert characters in the middle of            
                text without having to delete characters from the end.          
                A word of caution, though - you must then use the space         
                bar to add data to the end of a line.  Using the arrow          
                keys will cause the data to be left aligned after hitting       
                enter.  NULLS OFF causes data to be space-filled.               
    PROFILE   - causes the display of various edit mode indicators.             
    RESET     - causes a general resetting of intensified messages,             
                incomplete line commands, and special lines.                    
    SAVE      - causes the data to be stored back into the data set             
                and editing to continue.                                        
    SUB(MIT)  - causes the data being edited to be submitted to the             
                job stream. (Do not use while editing PAN books.)               
                                                                                
B)  LINE COMMANDS - these commands are entered anywhere in the left             
         side margin (they do not have to begin in column 1), and               
         can be of three formats (note that C is the command code):             
         Cn:  where n is a repitition factor. (Default is 1.)                   
         CC:  implies the start or end of a block for the command.              
         CCn: causes repetitions of a block of lines.                           
         Other line commands are input using a code name.                       
                                                                                
    a - line after which a moved or copied line is inserted.                    
    b - line before which a moved or copied line is inserted.                   
    c - copies the line.                                                        
    d - deletes the line.                                                       
    i - inserts a blank line after this line.                                   
    m - moves the line.                                                         
    o - line over which a moved or copied line is overlayed.                    
    r - repeats the line.                                                       
    x - excludes the line from display.                                         
    < - shift data to left.                                                     
    > - shift data to right.                                                    
    COL - displays column indicators.                                           
    BND - displays boundary positions - useful to limit searches.               
                                                                                
         <   > TSO Commands                                                     
                                                                                
    TSO commands are normally entered from option 6 in the main menu.           
Alternatively, they may be entered from the command line at the top of          
every screen by beginning the command with "TSO".  The following are            
some of the more useful commands.                                               
                                                                                
1. STATUS - Abbreviated ST, this command will display the status of all         
            jobs which are named with your userid plus 1 character.             
            Alternatively, you may specify as the second parameter the          
            jobname of any other job you wish to inquire on.  In this           
            case an exact match is required.                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
2. OUT - The OUT command is extremely useful for manipulation of job            
         output.  This command may only be used if the output class             
         (MSGCLASS) of the job was "X".  There are three forms of the           
         OUT command:                                                           
                                                                                
         a) OUT jobname K HO BE - will display the named "jobname" on           
            your screen, from the beginning. Display will be sequential,        
            going from screenful to screenful with each hit of enter.           
            Termination of the display is accomplished by pressing PA1          
            and responding with "END" to the OUT prompt.  ("K HO BE" stand      
            for Keep, Hold and Begin.  Keep & Hold are used to insure           
            the job stays on the queue after the display.  Begin insures        
            display from the beginning each time.)                              
                                                                                
    ______________________________________________________________________      
   º                                                                      º     
   º        IMPORTANT NOTE - After running assemblies, it is far easier,  º     
   º        quicker, and more efficient both of your time and CPU time,   º     
   º        to use the OUT command to determine whether or not you had    º     
   º        any assembly errors (rather than using the OUTLIST function-  º     
   º        see below.)  A condition code of 0000 on the ASM step         º     
   º        guarantees that you had no errors or warnings in your         º     
   º        assembly.                                                     º     
   º______________________________________________________________________º     
                                                                                
         b) OUT jobname NEW(c) - will requeue the named "jobname" to the        
            class signified by "c".  The most common output classes are:        
            J - 8 1/2 x 14 striped paper (1S) on systems impact printer.        
            T - 8 1/2 x 11 white paper (1P) on laser printer.                   
            A - 8 1/2 x 14 striped paper (1S) on laser printer.                 
                                                                                
         c) OUT jobname DEL - will delete the named "jobname".                  
                                                                                
   * Note that in all cases, "jobname" may include a job number.  When          
     there are more than one job on the queue with the same name, they          
     must be distinguished by their number.  An example of a delete             
     command would then be OUT name(jnnnn) DEL, where nnnn is the number.       
                                                                                
3. CANCEL - allows you to terminate the execution of any job which              
            begins with your userid.  With the optional PURGE parameter,        
            the job is deleted altogether from the queue (i.e., no              
            printout will occur either.)  The format of this command            
            is CANCEL jobname PURGE.                                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
4. SUBMIT - allows you to submit jobs.  Format of this command is               
            SUB 'datasetname(member)', where datasetname is the name of         
            the data set where "member" exists. There are two exceptions        
            to this rule:  First, if the data set name begins with your         
            userid then both the single quotes and your userid may be           
            omitted.  Second, if the data set is not partitioned, then          
            specification of a member name should be omitted. Examples:         
            a)  SUB DDS.JCL(PANALNK) - will submit member PANALNK from          
                                       your DDS.JCL data set.                   
            b)  SUB JCL.DATA - will submit the non-partitioned data set         
                               userid.JCL.DATA for execution.                   
                                                                                
                                                                                
5. VCI - a facility for displaying tape data set information. Hit enter         
          again. Enter CNTL in both the USER= and PASS= fields and hit enter.   
          Now enter the command "DSPLDSR,datasetname", where datasetname is     
          the name of the tape data set you wish to inquire on. After hitting   
          enter press PF2 to get tape numbers, etc. Type "end" to exit VCI.     
                                                                                
                                                                                
6. RMFMON - shows processing jobs.  Press PF1 to show list of jobs.             
            Your job may be looping if it isn't using any TCB time.             
            Enter "z" to exit.

     The following is a suggested use for the PF Keys which are engaged         
by pressing the ALT key and a number (usually corresponding to PF13 -           
PF24.)  The functions described here are for convenience sake, as well          
as to provide a level of consistency for everyone's terminals.  You are         
welcome to re-define any which you deem not useful.  Note that PF key           
definitions are entered by inputting 'KEYS' on the COMMAND line at the          
top of any screen.

Additional notes on PF Keys - The pre-defined PF4 (or on some keyboards,        
PF16) is RETURN.  We've found no use for this command, and when hit by          
accident during an edit session it takes you back to the main menu.  It         
is suggested that you re-define it.  A useful substitution is:                  
"F '*** ERROR' 13", which is useful for finding errors in assemblies.           
                                                                                
Also, for those who have never used it before, PF2 (PF14) can be a frightening  
experience.  PF2 engages the SPLIT command, which will cause a new              
screen to be inserted beginning wherever the cursor is.  You then can           
maintain two TSO screens at once.  Pressing PF9 (PF21) shifts control           
from one screen to the other.  PF12 (PF24) sends the cursor to the              
first unprotected field of the screen where the cursor is positioned.           
It is easiest to split your screens at the topmost line, since it               
enables you to see the entirety of each screen while you use it.                
                                                                                
                                                                                
         <   > Miscellaneous                                                    
                                                                                
1. If you accidently erase or change something on the screen, press             
   PA2 before hitting enter - this will restore the screen to its               
   appearance as of the most recent hit of enter.                               
                                                                                
2. Viewing jobs under the OUTLIST function (3.8).  A very useful tool           
   for browsing around large reports is the LABEL function.  You can            
   define labels at various points of the report so that switching from         
   one spot to another occurs almost immediately.  Inputting ".lblname"         
   at any line assigns that lblname to that spot.  To get to that line          
   from any other part of the listing simply input "L .lblname".  Use           
   of the locate command here uses a much faster process than using             
   finds, and using lblname is much easier than remembering line numbers.       
                                                                                
3. Another thing about OUTLIST - be sure never to leave just your userid        
   in the JOBNAME field.  Always have at least one character appended           
   to the end.  Your TSO session executes as a job with your userid as          
   its name.  Do not get it confused with a job you submitted.                  
                                                                                
4. ATTN key - stops processing of requested task.  Especially useful            
   when attempting to display a job in 3.8 and it takes too long, or            
   you only need to see the beginning.  After pressing ATTN respond             
   to OUTLIST prompt by typing END and then hit enter.  BEWARE - do             
   not use the ATTN key when saving PAN books - it screws up the works.         
                                                                                
5. If after exiting TSO (using option X from the main menu,) you realize        
   that you still needed to do something, it is not necessary to logoff.        
   Replying to the READY prompt with "ISPF" will return you to the main         
   menu.                                                                        
                                                                                
6. As discussed in the TSO SUBMIT command above, anywhere in TSO where          
   you are required to enter a data set name surrounded by single quotes,       
   both the quotes and your userid may be omitted if the data set name          
   begins with your userid.                                                     
                                                                                
7. Be sure to define your ISPF LOG default.  This will make it easier           
   to logoff at the end of each session.  Unless the default is                 
   defined, you will need to deal with the LOG screen each time you             
   attempt to logoff.  Enter "0.2" from the main menu to get to the             
   LOG AND LIST DEFAULTS screen.  Enter "D" as the Process option for           
   the LOG DATA SET, and "J" as the Process option for the LIST DATA SET.       
                                                                                
8. One of the following cards should be placed immediately after the JOB        
   card in any job you submit:                                                  
   a) //*MAIN CLASS=LONGJOB - only for VERY long running jobs.                  
   b) //*MAIN CLASS=SYSTEMS - for all other jobs.                               
                                                                                
9. The following cards may be placed immediately following the //*MAIN          
   card from above.  They stop the JESMSG, JESJCL and SYSMSG portions           
   from printing out.  Most of the time these sections are useless to           
   you and waste of paper, so include these:                                    
   //*FORMAT PR,DDNAME=JESMSG,COPIES=0                                          
   //*FORMAT PR,DDNAME=JESJCL,COPIES=0                                          
   //*FORMAT PR,DDNAME=SYSMSG,COPIES=0
