         TITLE 'PANXREF'                                                        
EXECutable module searches Pan library members for                              
      a) data dictionary references,                                            
      b) ++include names,                                                       
      c) specified character strings,                                           
and produces a cross-referenced report. PANXREF uses the latest Pan             
backup tape, so it doesn't lock the Pan library (unlike PANSCAN).
