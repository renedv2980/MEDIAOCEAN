         TITLE 'ANSR'                                                           
The ANSR macro generates a standard XIT1 but also generates code to set         
the condition code for testing equal or unequal.  To set the unequal cc         
you would branch to NO, for equal cc branch to YES.  The XIT1 generated         
contains the label XIT.                                                         
                                                                                
If you don't want the XIT1 generated code X=N in col. 16.  You will get         
a note saying that you must provide the XIT1 if you want it to be a             
subroutine exit and you won't get the label XIT.                                
                                                                                
If you specify C=* (* = any valid character in a BAL symbol, e.g., A),          
then all generated labels (YES, NO, XIT) will have this character               
appended to them.  For example, C=F will cause the labels YESF, NOF,            
and XITF to be generated instead of YES, NO, and XIT.
