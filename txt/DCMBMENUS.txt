MENUGEN is a routine in the controller phase of MBLFM, which can be             
called by an MBLFM overlay to perform one of two functions:                     
                                                                                
1. Provide a menu in response to a user request for help, eg a list             
   of qualifiers or a list of the available values for a qualifier type         
   or other type:                                                               
                                                                                
2. Load a 'page-number' screen in response to a user request to scroll          
   forward or back a page, eg when using BASE.1, 2 or 3: this must always       
   be done via MENUGEN rather than by an overlay CALLOV call, because           
   the MBLFM controller needs to know that the menu hierarchy has changed.      
                                                                                
P/BYTE     DESCRIPTION (see MBMENUGEND for further details)                     
------     -----------                                                          
1/0        Call type                                                            
           The only settings relevant to overlay calls are:                     
           X'04' (MNGHLPQ) - indicates a help call                              
           X'02' (MNGFLTQ) - in the case of a help call, indicates that         
                             filtering is required by reference to the          
                             set of values available to this mediabase          
                             member.                                            
           For a simple screen load (page n) the call type should be null.      
                                                                                
1/1        Type of internal code of type: for overlay calls this is             
           forced to X'80' = MNGGLBQ = Global                                   
1/2-3      Type internal code - for a simple screen load this is the            
           page number internal code as two bytes (eg MBQBASE1 or MBQBASE2).    
                                                                                
2          Nulls for overlay calls                                              
                                                                                
3/0-3      If help call, address of the overlay screen field header             
           for which the help request was issued. This field should             
           contain a '?' at the location at which any value selected            
           by the user via menu (X or X=Y) should subsequently be               
           inserted or appended.                                                
                                                                                
4          Nulls for overlay calls                                              
                                                                                
5/0        If help call, override help panel number to be set in the            
           extended header of title-line Select field and of list-line          
           ones that dont have specific help panels (MBTPANEL), instead         
           of the MBVAL help panel for this type.                               
           Null = use standard MBVAL help panel.                                
           X'FF'= suppress help panel.                                          
5/1-3      Undefined                                                            
                                                                                
After MENUGEN                                                                   
-------------                                                                   
1/0        X'FF' (MNGBADQ) = bad call ie parameters invalid                     
           Also condition code is set to NEQ if invalid                         
                                                                                
Note that in the case of a valid help call, MENUGEN will exit direct            
to the user (via GENERAL/MBLFM00/MONITOR) so the overlay must ensure            
before the call that all essential file-marking etc has been completed.         
After the user has made selections from the menu(s), the overlay will           
be re-entered as normal from the beginning as if the user had input the         
selected data into the overlay screen.
