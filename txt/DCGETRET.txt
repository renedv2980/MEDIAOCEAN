         TITLE 'GETRET - Routine to compute retention date and time'            
                                                                                
GETRET takes an input date (YMD binary) and time (HM binary) plus a             
number of hours and computes an output date and time for the next               
working day. It takes into account weekends and national holidays which         
do not count as working days.                                                   
                                                                                
If the input date/time is not a working day it is moved forward to the          
next working day before the retain period is applied. This is best shown        
by some examples.

Fri Feb10/06 1200 plus 13 hours = Mon Feb13/06 0100                             
                                                                                
This routine was designed originally to compute retain times for reports        
added to the print queue (PQ) that typically have a well defined life           
cycle. Someone who adds a report on a Friday afternoon that is supposed         
to be retained for 24 hours would expect it to be valid until Monday PM.        
                                                                                
There are several options that can be specified in the call to modify           
how the date is calculated.The default is as above for the country that         
is the default at the time of the call. The country code can be passed          
GRDCTRY to override the default country.                                        
                                                                                
If the retain hours passed in GRDHRS is zeros then no calulation is             
done on the output date/Time. It is set to the input date/time. If the          
retain hours is set to X'FFFF' then the output date is set to the               
maximum DDS date. This is currently DEC31/2027.                                 
                                                                                
If an invalid date is passed an error code of 01 is returned. If in             
invalid time is passed an errpr 02 is returned. If the input date or the        
output date is out of range of the calendars then 03 is returned. All           
errors will also return the mad date/time supported in the output.              
                                                                                
The routine also has code to compute the output date without the aid of         
calendars. If the caller sets a flag GRDFCALC then the output date is           
calculated. If the input or ouput date is out of range then the output          
date is calculated and a flag (GRDICALR) is set to inform the caller.           
                                                                                
The calculation routine can give a different result from the calendar           
routine. The calendar routine takes the number of input hours and               
divides by 24 to give the number of days. It then uses the calendar             
to skip this number of WORKING days. This includes all weekends plus            
national holidays. The calculation routine takes the number of days             
and computes the output date based on 7 days in a week i.e.it does not          
know about weekends and holidays. It adjusts the input date if it is a          
weekend and it also adjustes the computed ouput date if its a weekend.          
Flags can be set to allow start and/or end date to be a weekend day.            
                                                                                
If you set the compute flag and pass 8760 as the number of hours it will        
return a date one year in the future. However as long as there are no           
national holidays the calculated date will agree with the calendar date         
for short periods. Calulated date does not support going backwards.             
                                                                                
GRDFBACK - Subtract the number of hours from the input date. This makes         
           the calulation work in reverse.                                      
GRDFHLOC - Allow start date to be weekend or holiday. Do not advance to         
           the next or previous working day.                                    
GRDFCTRY - Pass back the country code in GRDCTRY.                               
GRDFTAL  - Use the special US talent system calendar.                           
GRDFCALC - Always calculate the output date/time. Don't use calendars.          
GRDFHLND - Allow end date to be weekend or holiday. Do not advance to           
           the next or previous working day.                                    
                                                                                
Once the output date/time has been computed (or copied if zero retain           
hours are passed) the day of the week is computed (1=Mon,7=Sun) and             
passed back in GRDRETI. The high order bit of this day number is set            
to X'80' if this is a weekend day (6 or 7) or to X'40' is the date is           
a national or public holiday. The X'20' bit is set if the date is out           
of range and it was calculated.                                                 
                                                                                
Note that when DDS knows that clients will be taking extended leave in          
and around holiday periods (Christmas is a classic example) extra days          
will we flagged as non-working days to help ensure that PQ reports              
requested before a holiday period are still around afterwards. However          
the passing back of the public holiday flag GRDIPHOL will only happen           
for an official public holiday.                                                 
                                                                                
DDGETRETD defines the 16 byte control block passed to GETRET. Sample            
code and the control block fields are shown below. The input date/time          
is range checked to ensure it is within range of the current calendar           
which is typically covers 12 to 18 months in the future.
