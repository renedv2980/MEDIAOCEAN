           Compressing/Uncompressing Data using PKZIP Online                    
           -------------------------------------------------                    
                                                                                
Modules involved: DDZIP     (calls PKZIP in own address space)                  
                  DDZIPFAC  (calls DDZIP from FACPAK)                           
                  DDZIPTEST (for testing DDZIP offline)                         
                  DDZIPWRKD (parameters application passes to DDZIPFAC)         
                  FATABSZIP (defines layout of dataspace tables)                
                                                                                
PKZIP DCLs are third party software tools which will compress and               
decompress a stream of data, if called correctly                                
                                                                                
An interface to these tools has been written, to allow them to be called        
from Facpak. The interface is in DDZIPFAC, and it has a parameter list          
defined in DDZIPWORKD.                                                          
                                                                                
DDZIPFAC is linked into FACPAK, the address may be found in SYSFACS.            
                                                                                
           Calling DDZIPFAC.                                                    
           -----------------                                                    
                                                                                
The following assumptions are made for any program calling DDZIPFAC             
1. Caller is in 24-bit mode                                                     
2. Caller has Access registers OFF.                                             
                                                                                
If you have access registers stored, they will be preserved, but you            
will be returned in 24-bit SAC 0 state.                                         
                                                                                
NOTE: Your data buffer may not be more than the current size of TZBUFLEN        
      found in FATABSZIP                                                        
                                                                                
           What happens when you call DDZIPFAC.                                 
           ------------------------------------                                 
                                                                                
A seperate address space contains the PKZIP code, with an interface on          
the front of it. There may be more than one copy of this module running         
simultaneously.                                                                 
                                                                                
ZIPFAC moves your data into a slot in the TABS dataspace. It then posts         
DDZIP to tell it new work is available, before waiting (via ADWAIT if           
we are multitasking) until processing is complete.                              
                                                                                
ZIPFAC then moves your data to the output buffer before returning               
control to the calling application.
