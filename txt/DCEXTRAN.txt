   TITLE 'EXTRACT SYSTEM MAINFRAME-SERVER COMMUNICATIONS CONTROLS'              
                                                                                
   For Mainframe to Server file transfer we have included control data          
in header and trailer records sent as the first and last records in an          
extract file.                                                                   
   Each record contains a series of fixed length fields separated by            
a ';' character. The Header record is described by
