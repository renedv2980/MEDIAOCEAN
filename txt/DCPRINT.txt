         TITLE 'PRINT'                                                          
Handles the printing of a single line of data on SYSLST. This module is used by 
PRINTER, REPORT etc. and would not normally be required except for special      
printer control.                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
Parameter 1                  A(byte before 132-byte print line)

                              Byte 2-3 cc=channel (01-12)                       
                                       ll=lines   (01-99)                       
                                                                                
 Notes                                                                          
 -----                                                                          
Print after advancing is to be avoided as it causes 2 print cycles. Skipping of 
up to 99 lines is supported but more than 3 is inefficient on IBM printers and  
should be avoided.                                                              
                                                                                
If you link DOCPRINT instead of PRINT, this will also cause cards to be punched 
that conform to the Lnn and Rnn formats that are described in the PANPRINT      
documentation. This allows sample reports to be used in manuals.
