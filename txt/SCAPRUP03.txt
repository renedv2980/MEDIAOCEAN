We have established an order for processing multiple check requests made on the
same day.  

The fields you use for your Check Request (A55) will control the order in which
the checks are processed.  Each field on the request screen has a value.       
Requests which have used  fields of higher value are processed first.  If two  
requests have the same "highest value" field, the system looks for the next    
highest value field, and so on.  

The order in which the requests are made has no effect on the order in which
