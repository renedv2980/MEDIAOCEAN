         TITLE 'PERF'                                                           
The PERF macro is good if you often forget to key in the RE, when coding        
DDS standard BAL instructions (those using RE).                                 
                                                                                
It simply translates from "PERF subrtn" to "BAL RE,subrtn".  By coding          
T=n you can repeate the BAL up to three times. "PERF sub,T=3" would             
generate BAL RE,sub
