Module called by application to edit searchable fields.                         
                                                                                
Two operating modes. One analyses a field and invokes search if                 
required, the other constructs data in 'extended field' format.                 
                                                                                
'Extended field' format is a way of allowing long search arguments              
in what would otherwise be a short input field. For example, if                 
a screen might display client in the following way:                             
                                                                                
     CLIENT ACM_____ ASSOCIATED COMBINED MEGAGLOMERATE                          
                                                                                
where 'ACM' is in a small input field, while the rest is protected,             
the screen could be redefined to combine the input field and the                
protected 'full name' field into one long input field, in this way              
the above example could display as                                              
                                                                                
     CLIENT ACM      <ASSOCIATED COMBINED MEGACLOMERATE>                        
                                                                                
where only the word 'CLIENT' is protected, the rest is a single,                
extended, input field.                                                          
                                                                                
Search is invoked whenever the input is found to contain an '='                 
sign in the first position.                                                     
                                                                                
Whenever an input field is analysed, the first '<' and everything               
after it is removed, and the field header adjusted accordingly.                 
This is done before testing for the leading '=' sign, so that                   
no modification is required to existing validation code.                        
                                                                                
The second call form will move a given key and full name into                   
the field in the extended format.
