           EXTED provides EDIT facilities for any currency by building          
           a parameter list for and calling EXTEDIT with reference to a         
           table of currencies built by BLDCUR.  EXTED is an extension          
           of CURED.                                                            
           (SEE DOBLDCUR)

INPUT      As for EDIT macro excluding TIME and DAY features. Labels may        
-----      be longer than 8 characters (eg. BILLABLE+4) and adcons              
           are accepted.                                                        
                                                                                
OUTPUT     OUTPUT or (L,OUTPUT) where L = 1 - 30 and may be a number,           
------     an equate or may be contained in a register.  When OUTPUT            
           is the address of an output area and L is not coded, then            
           L defaults to L'OUTPUT.  OUTPUT is addressed by a register           
           or is the address of the output area.                                
                                                                                
CURR ENTRY May be a register or adcon or the address of the CURRENCY            
---------- TABLE entry for this currency.(eg. ACURR1 (see DCBLDCUR))            
           If an integer is specified (or an equate name in quotes)             
           it will be interpreted as the number of decimal places and           
           will be inserted in a dummy currency table of all zeros.             
           TRAIL=x may be specified only if a numeric or equated name           
           is used in this parameter.                                           
                                                                                
MODADDR=   Passes the address of EXTEDIT if this is not held in EXTEDIT.        
                                                                                
DMCB=      Passes address of a FULLWORD alternative to DMCB for the             
           parameter list passed to EXTEDIT.                                    
                                                                                
CURSYMB=YES Causes this currency's symbol to be appended to the value           
           as a prefix or suffix as appropriate to the currency.                
                                                                                
CURSYMB=S  (SHORT) causes just the first character of the currency              
           symbol to be used as a prefix or suffix to the value.                
                                                                                
DECS=NO    Causes decimal places, if any, to be dropped.                        
                                                                                
DECS=ROUND Causes decimal places, if any, to be dropped and the value           
           to be rounded.                                                       
                                                                                
DECPNT=F   Causes a decimal point character before the decimal places           
           and the use of a comma character as the comma separator.             
                                                                                
LANG=      Provides the language number to be used for the edit.  If            
           the language number is zero or if LANG= is omitted, then             
           the rules for the edit are determined by the user's current          
           language.  If a non-zero language number is specified, and           
           CURSYMB=YES, and CURR is an integer; then the currency symbol        
           is determined based on the language specified.                       
                                                                                
COMFACS=   Passes address of a FULLWORD alternative to COMFACS for the          
           name of the field that contains the address of COMFACS.              
                                                                                
           Other options are as for the EDIT macro.                             
                                                                                
Note:      EXTED uses registers R1, RE and RF.                                  
           Also, like EDIT, it returns the significant length in R0, if         
           ALIGN=LEFT is specified.
