         TITLE 'CVBX and CVDX'                                                  
There is a special technique that can be used for storing numbers that exceed   
the capacity of a full-word within 4 bytes.                                     
                                                                                
The top two bits have a special significance.                                   
                                                                                
     X'80' large positive numbers (implies x100)                                
     X'C0' regular negative numbers                                             
     X'00' regular positive numbers                                             
                                                                                
     CVBX  FULL,DUB           Converts 8-byte packed to 4-byte special.         
                                                                                
     CVDX  DUB,FULL           Converts 4-byte special to 8-byte packed.
