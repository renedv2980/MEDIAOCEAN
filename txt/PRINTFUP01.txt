Billing Interface Tapes Now Requestable

As of January 1, 1985, you can request your own PRODPAK billing interface tapes.
                                                                               
This will allow you more flexibility by being able to produce tapes without    
contacting DDS.  Note that DDS will produce your tapes regularly scheduled for 
December, but after that we will no longer be requesting them for you.         
         SPACE 1                                                                
Please note that the request dates for the ACI1 refer to the  posting date,    
not the date of the billing request.  There is a one-day delay from the request
date for all billing postings, e.g., if you request billing on Monday, it will 
not be posted until Tuesday.  Be sure to use the posting date, not the         
billing request date, when you request interface tapes.
