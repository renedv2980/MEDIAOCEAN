         TITLE 'XMOD1'                                                          
Macro generates a set of code to return from a called module initialised by     
NMOD1 to the calling module, and to return the module's requested working       
storage back to the pool. Any module initialised by NMOD1 should exit via       
XMOD1 or via XIT1.                                                              
                                                                                
(Name)   XMOD1 n                                                                
                                                                                
N is an integer which is the number of levels to exit to.                       
                                                                                
XMOD1 restores the registers of the calling module and returns to that module   
via its register RE.
