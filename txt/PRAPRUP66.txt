If you have to set up multiple accounts and filters whenever you add a client, 
product, or job -- now there's an easier way.

You can now set up analysis accounts and filters at the same time you set up a 
client, product, or job, by using three new screens in the ACCPAK File Program.
The new screens are the MCLIENT, MPRODUCT, and MJOB screens.  You can use them 
whenever you set up a client, product, or job, to simultaneously add:

The new screens eliminate the need to set up these accounts and production     
filters in separate steps, by combining fields from the regular Client,        
Product, and Job Screens, and from the relevant Account Screens (Unit S/Ledger 
J, Unit S/Ledger R, Unit 1/Ledger C, and, for Expense users, Unit 2/Ledger 9).

You can add any or all of the above accounts or filters on any client, product,
or job, or leave them off, depending on your accounting requirements.  (If you 
don't have to enter any of this additional information, you can continue to use
the regular Client, Product, or Job screens.)  Each of the new screens is
