 Output Expressions                                                             
 ------------------                                                             
                                                                                
Output field length, if provided, must be an absolute expression which          
evaluates between the range 1 and 17 bytes.                                     
                                                                                
Output         Length defaults to L'Output, Output is A(field)                  
(L,(Rn))       Length explicitly provided,  Rn contains A(field)                
(L,Output)     Length explicitly provided,  Output is A(field)                  
                                                                                
 Optional Expressions                                                           
 --------------------                                                           
                                                                                
(,n)            Up to six decimal places (must be third operand).               
(,COMMAS=YES)   Inserts significant commas (example 1,234,567).                 
(,CR=YES)       Will put a CR into last two bytes for minus fields.             
(,ALIGN=LEFT)   Will left-align output fields.                                  
(,FILL=c)       Non-significant characters filled with c not blank.             
(,FLOAT=c)      A character c will be floated in before significant data.       
                If the character is -, this will only occur if the input        
                field is minus.                                                 
(,WRK=mywork)   EDIT uses 17 bytes of field called WORK. If user does not have  
                WORK or is using WORK as parameter, another field can be sub-   
                stituted.                                                       
(,DUB=mydub)    Edit uses DUB. User can substitute his own double-word.         
(,MINUS=YES)    Will put a - into the last byte for minus input fields.         
(,BRACKET=YES)  Will wrap brackets round resultant fields.                      
(,TRAIL=c)      Adds trailing character C after last significant byte.          
(,ZERO=BLANK)   Forces zero fields to print blank.                              
(,ZERO=NOBLANK) Forces zero fields to print zero.  (This applies only to fields 
                whose actual value is zero.  It does not print leading zeroes.) 
(,DROP=n)       Clears up to n trailing zeros.                                  
                                                                                
 Notes                                                                          
 -----                                                                          
                                                                                
R0 will contain the value of the input in binary except when (,ALIGN=LEFT) is   
specified when it will contain the number of significant characters. When input 
is packed or EBCDIC, R0 is unaffected.  R0 is clobbered when (,BRACKET=YES) is  
specified.                                                                      
                                                                                
R1 is unaffected unless (,FLOAT=c) or (,BRACKET=YES) is specified; for          
(,FLOAT=c), R1 is set to the address of the inserted float character within     
WORK (not in output).                                                           
                                                                                
Input and output may be expressed either as a field or as a base and            
displacement (example 24(R4) ).                                                 
                                                                                
DUB or mydub will contain the packed value of the input after edit.             
                                                                                
2, 3 or 4 byte binary fields are considered to be negative when the top bit is  
on.
