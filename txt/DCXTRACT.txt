Introduction                                                                    
------------                                                                    
   The following is a description of the System file offline                    
extract control program DXTRACT. This acts as a generalised controller          
calling system specific sub programs as loaded phases. Data is                  
extracted from the mainframe Facpak system files, converted into                
'flat' format records and written to an MVS data set for eventual               
update of the target PC server data bases, (e.g. SQL database.)                 
The system specific sub program has the responsibility of extracting            
the sub set of data required and converting it to a format tailored             
to suit the particular remote PC application.                                   
   DXTRACT operates in Load or Update mode. Load mode is intended               
to call that part of system sub program which extracts database                 
initialisation data records directly from the system files.                     
Update mode passes system recovery file records at periodic intervals           
from every hour to daily update cycles. The process insures that no             
overlap with previous passes of the recovery file occur. System                 
recovery file records are passed one at a time to the sub system                
program in update mode which then filters and converts data                     
as required. Any resulting record is then written with a 'PUT'                  
style interface to the opened MVS data set by DXTRACT.                          
   DXTRACT in Update mode can also read records from Tape file                  
backups of previous days recovery files.                                        
   The MVS data set is written with Header and Trailer records                  
which define information used to control transfer and update                    
of the data on the remote PC/ESS destination. This data is derived              
from Xtract transfer control records on the CON/GEN file, AKA                   
'SQLPAK', which including XAGENCY, XFILE, XTRANS and XAPPL records.             
These Xtract transfer control records are updated to indicate                   
when file is awaiting transfer to PC/ESS destination.                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
Control blocks                                                                  
--------------                                                                  
   DXTRACT contains a table which associates sub system program                 
phase name with its 'key' composed of SYSTEM and SUB SYSTEM                     
characters. The sub system program is called with parameter one                 
containing the address of the extract control system data block                 
I.e. On entry to sub system program:

   This is defined by DSECT 'DXBLOCKD' in source book DXDSECTS which            
should be INCLUDED within the sub system program. This also contains            
a pointer to a further sub system specific control block defined                
by DSECT 'SXDTABD'. Registers can be pointed to each of these                   
control blocks on entry to the sub system program.
