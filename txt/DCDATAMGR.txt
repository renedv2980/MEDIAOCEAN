         TITLE 'DATAMGR'                                                        
All disk reading, writing and adding is handled through DATAMGR. It is          
conventional to use a separate parameter list for DATAMGR calls with a          
special name of DMCB (Data Manager Control Block) defined as DS 6F.

------------                                                                    
DMADD  - Add a record. Key is taken from record at DMCBW4. DMCBW3 is            
         ignored. Cant do DMRSEQ after add as sequencing is destroyed.          
DMREAD - Read a record into DMCBW4 with key = to key at DMCBW3                  
DMRDHI - Read a record into DMCBW4 with key > or = key at DMCBW3.               
DMRSEQ - Read the next record sequentially. A previous record must have         
         been established by a DMREAD,DMRDHI,or DMRSEQ. DMCBW3 ignored.         
DMWRT  - Write back the record last read. DMCBW3 is ignored. Key in             
         record at DMCBW4 can not change from the key of last record            
         read by DMREAD,DMRDHI,or DMRSEQ.                                       
                                                                                
D/A Commands                                                                    
------------                                                                    
ADDREC - Add record defined in DMCBW4 to XXXFIL. Return disk address of         
         new record at DMCBW3. Extract Key,Status bytes,and disk addr           
         and add a directory pointer to XXXDIR.                                 
GETREC - Get record with disk address at DMCBW3 and read into i/o area          
         at DMCBW4. Intitialises i/o work area defined by DMCBW5.               
PUTREC - Put record at DMCBW4 back to disk. Record is written back to           
         location defined by DMCBW5 (created by GETREC on read). Note           
         that a GETREC/Process/PUTREC sequence will be destroyed if an          
         intermeadiate GETREC (after the first GETREC) is issued for            
         another record using the same I/O work area in DMCBW5.                 
                                                                                
Special Comand options in DMCBW1(1)                                             
----------------------------------                                              
X'80'    Read for update. If a record is read that will be changed by a         
         subsequent write then this bit must be turned on or the write          
         command will be rejected.                                              
X'08'    Pass back deleted records. If the X'80' bit of the first status        
         byte in a record is turned on the record is considered deleted.        
         A not found return code (X'10') is given if an attempt to read         
         a deleted record unless the pass back deleted record bit is set        
X'24'    Read Flush. Turn these bits on to force a read of record direct        
         from disk ignoring an old copy that might be lying around.             
                                                                                
X'28'    Recovery files - want logically deleted records.                       
X'2C'    Recovery files - want logically deleted records camplete with          
         task id in header.                                                     
                                                                                
X'24'    Maintenance update - mark recovery file with special flag.             
         This stops update/add appearing on client change data reports.         
                                                                                
X'22'    Activity data - pass back activity date/time in linkage field.         
X'28'    Activity data - do not change activity date/time on PUTREC.            
                                                                                
                                                                                
Return Code in DMCBW3(1)                                                        
------------------------                                                        
Before exit DMDMGR compares the return code at 8(R1) with zero. So after        
calling DATAMGR a BNZ can be issued to pass control to exception routine        
in the program. The program should test for disk errors,or end-of-file          
errors on add,and die so that a dump can be analysed to troubleshoot            
hardware problems.                                                              
                                                                                
Format of I/S XXXDIR and D/A XXXFIL file pairs                                  
----------------------------------------------                                  
I/S  <Key......><Status><DiskAddr>                                              
                                                                                
D/A  <Key......><Reclen><Status><Linkage><First El>......<Last El><0>           
                                                                                
The Status area is at least one byte long and is fixed length for a             
given XXXDIR/XXXFIL pair. The DiskAddr is 4 btyes long X'TTTTBBRR' where        
TTTT is the track number, BB the block number, and RR the record number         
within the block. The record length is two bytes long and should equal          
the sum of Keylen,Reclen,Status,Linkage, and all of the individual              
elements, plus (optionally) the zero byte that denotes end of record.           
The linkage area is 4 bytes long and is reserved for use by DATAMGR. It         
should always be binary zeros.
