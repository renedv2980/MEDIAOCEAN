  CODEX provides the facility to validate and to display codes that adhere      
its formatting rules. CODEX codes have a compressed internal format and an      
expanded display format. This routine basically translates between the two      
in addition to providing some other utilities.  It was designed to deal with    
complex structures like British postal codes which have variable length         
levels and a mixture of alphabetic and numeric codes.                           
                                                                                
  CODEX is passed a control table, each entry of which describes a level        
in the code structure. (See pan book DDCDXTAB).                                 
                                                                                
  For validation, the following are acceptable separators between levels        
blank (any number of them), /, comma, dot, hyphen.  Separators are always       
permitted, but are not required in two cases-                                   
                                                                                
    - A field that is present at its maximum length does not need to            
      be followed by a separator.                                               
                                                                                
    - No separator is needed between an alphabetic field and a numeric          
      one. The change of character type is sufficient to mark the end           
      of field.                                                                 
                                                                                
  For numeric fields a value of 0 is not permitted.                             
                                                                                
  In the internal representation, a code at a given level will have             
values down to that level and nulls for lower levels.                           
                                                                                
  For both validation and display, CODEX returns the number of                  
levels actually present in the code.                                            
                                                                                
  For validation, values can be repeated from a previous call to CODEX. If a    
given level has no new value, the value in the existing internal code is        
preserved. For example, ///ABC will set ABC as the value for the 4th level      
but leave levels 1,2, and 3 unchanged.  Obviously, blanks cannot be used as     
separators in this case.  There must be actual values for the higher levels     
or a missing field error is returned.
