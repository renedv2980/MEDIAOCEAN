BUFFALO USES ONE DISK FILE CALLED BILL SO DLBL AND EXTENT ARE NEEDED.           
BUFFALO USES ALTERNATE TRACKS FOR INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES AND FLIP-FLOPS         
BETWEEN THE TWO.

WHEN YOU PUT A RECORD TO BUFFALO, YOU MUST ADDRESS A RECORD THAT STARTS         
WITH KEY AS SPECIFIED IN BUFF AND CONTINUES WITH 1 ROW OF ACCUMUALTORS.         
THE OTHER ROWS WILL BE PRE-CLEARED FOR YOU.

WHEN YOU GET A RECORD FROM BUFFALO (OR HIGH OR SEQ) YOU WILL BE PASSED          
BACK THE KEY FOLLOWED BY THE ROW OF ACCUMULATORS SPECIFIED BY THE               
,ROW PARAMETER.  IF YOU SPECIFY ROW 0 (,0) YOU WILL GET THE KEY FOLLOWED        
BY EVERY ROW OF ACCUMULATORS.

WHEN YOU GET A RECORD SEQUENTIALLY (SEQ), THE KEY OF THE RECORD YOU GET         
IS COMPARED AGAINST THE PREVIOUS RECORD.  (IT IS ASSUMED THAT YOUR THIRD        
PARAMETER IS STILL POINTING TO THIS).  BUFFALO WILL DETECT THE LEVEL OF         
CONTROL BREAK, AND THIS WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IN BUFFCB.  BUFFUSER            
WILL CONTAIN THE CODE THAT YOU ASSOCIATED WITH THAT LEVEL OF BREAK WHEN         
YOU SET UP YOUR KEYLIST IN BUFF.

THE BUFFER SPACE (BUFFAREA) AT THE END OF THE CSECT SHOULD NOT BE               
REFERENCED DIRECTLY.  AS A MATTER OF INTEREST, THE FIRST R BYTES ARE            
USED AS A LOGICAL RECORD AREA AND THE REMAINING L*R BYTES CONSTITUTE            
THE CORE BUFFER WHERE R=RECORD LENGTH AND L=LINES.
