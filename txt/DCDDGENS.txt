A) Introduction                                                                 
---------------                                                                 
                                                                                
     DDGEN is an offline utility program with which a Data Dictionary           
source book from the Pan library can be compiled. This produces a               
listing detailing any compilation errors and the option of a link edit          
step to generate Data Dictionary load phases on DDS.LOADLIB from any            
object modules produced by clean compilations.                                  
                                                                                
     The load phases are named in a standard form for the particular            
system and language. The program passes through the compilation                 
step for each of the languages requested.                                       
                                                                                
     The program is run by submitting JCL catalogued procedure DDGEN            
and run options are controlled by the following card data input lines.

--------------------------------                                                
                                                                                
     The Data Dictionary file consists of a sequence of lines which             
     can include Term entries and comment lines.

2)   Format of Term entry line is as follows:                                   
                                                                                
<Equate#><Language symbol><Term delimiter><List{<String><Delimiter>}>           
                                                                                
     Where:                                                                     
                                                                                
<Equate#> : 4 digit equate number for entry starts Col(01)  e.g. 0123           
     or      Blanks if continuation to previous (See (4) below)                 
<Language symbol> : 1 character symbol starts Col(03)                           
     either, Language symbol, i.e. initial letter from system LANGTAB.          
     or      'U' - Alternative US entry.                                        
     or      'X' - Unused entry line.                                           
     or      Blanks if continuation as above                                    
<Term delimiter> : 1 character symbol starts Col(06)                            
     either, '>' standard start of entry string list                            
     or      '<' as above, also indicates special status for edit               
     or      '?' as above, also indicates special 'unfinished' state            
<List{<String><Delimiter>}> : starting in Col(07) list in ascending             
     order of {<string><Delimiter>} upto Col(72)                                
<String> : Data dictionary entry text.                                          
     Must be at least 1 character                                               
     Must be at least 1 string in list                                          
     String can be in 'SEPARATED' format e.g. :                                 
     '>  First half:  Second half>'                                             
     where ':' is separator character. First half text must be                  
     same length as second half text.                                           
<Delimiter> : 1 character symbol '>' indicates end of string                    
                                                                                
3) Line can be continued by using same value for <Equate#> and                  
     <Language symbol>, (or both blank,) though <String> length                 
     should continue to be in ascending order.                                  
                                                                                
4) <Language symbol> = 'U' must follow an English i.e. 'E' entry for            
     the current equate number. This represents a US text entry and             
     overides the English text if compiled for US.                              
                                                                                
5) <Equate#>  should be either the same or of greater value on each             
     subsequent line.                                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
E) Notes.                                                                       
---------                                                                       
                                                                                
1)   A separate file of Data Dictionary Note entries for use with               
     utilities DDREPORT and DDMAINT can be maintained. This consists            
     of a sequence of lines which can include Note entries and                  
     comment lines.                                                             
                                                                                
     Format of Note entry line is as follows:                                   
                                                                                
<Equate#><Language symbol><Note delimiter><Comment text>                        
                                                                                
     Where:                                                                     
                                                                                
<Note delimiter> : 1 character symbol ' '  (i.e. blank)                         
<Comment text> : the descriptive text upto Col(72)
