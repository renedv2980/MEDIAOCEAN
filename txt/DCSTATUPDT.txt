All online transactions are monitored as they pass through the adpak system.    
various values that reflect the usage of the system resources are collected into
a data record for each transaction which is added to the adpak data recorder    
file (ADRFILE). The values that are recorded include the following :-

At the end of each day the ADRFILE is sorted and processed to give the mean     
values for all transactions for each terminal and each program. the daily values
are then written to the adpak statistics file (STATS). The daily values are also
integrated into a set of cumulative values maintained in the stats file. thus   
the stats file contains a record for each terminal and program which includes   
the following :-

Two basic report programs are available for the printing of information         
contained in the stats file. The program STATREPT produces a listing of all     
field values for terminals and/or programs for a daily and/or cumulative period.
the program STATHOUR produces a listing of a nominated field value (eg. average 
cpu time) broken down into hourly periods for terminals and/or programs for a   
daily and/or cumulative period.                                                 
                                                                                
STATMAKE

The program STATMAKE is used to initialise the statistics file (STATS). the file
is defined by a set of parameter cards which give the size of the file and the  
ids of the programs that are to be maintained.                                  
                                                                                
The first card gives the size of the file. its format is as follows :

The following cards define which programs are to be maintained. The format is   
as follows :-

The order of these cards defines the listing order for program oriented reports.
the number of cards must not exceed the value specified in the size card.       
for a given system if it is desired to nominate specific programs and to group  
all other programs into one entry this can by done by specifying a program      
number of 00 and a suitable program name (eg others). If a given system does    
not include a program number 00 card then programs other than those actually    
nominated will be ignored.

A STATS file big enough to accomodate 300 terminals and 50 programs is created. 
all service requests are to be grouped under one miscellaneous heading.         
three account system programs are to be individually monitored with all other   
account programs grouped under others.                                          
Only two spot system programs are to be monitored.

The program STATUPDT should be run at the end of each day to update the file    
with the day's data stored in adrfile. It is re-runable in the event of         
unsucessful completion.The ADRFILE is read and written to tape ADROUT plus a    
second tape ADROUT2 can be created unless inhibited by PARM=xxx1xxxx. If the    
only requirement is to dump ADRFILE to ADROUT use PARM=01011000.                
                                                                                
A program index record created by STATMAKE is used to define which programs are 
to be monitored.                                                                
                                                                                
Terminal index records are used and created by STATUPDT to facilitate access to 
the STATS file by report programs. The terminal index is maintained in terminal 
address within line is sequence. A new line and/or terminal is automatically    
catered for.

The STATS file contains 1232 byte fixed length records. Each record has a 16    
byte header the first byte of which defines the record type. There are three    
record types : index records,terminal records,and program records.

The first group of records are index records with record type x'00'. each index 
record has a 16 byte header containing the following fields.

The next 1200 bytes contains the index entries and the last 16 bytes contains

The first record is the program index which contains a maximum of 60 entries    
each of 20 bytes. Unused entries are filled with x'ff'. The order of the index  
is the sequence of input cards to the statmake program. Each entry contains     
the following fields.

The second record and subsequent records are terminal index records. each       
record contains a maximum of 100 entries each of 12 bytes. The number of program
index records depends on the parameter to the statmake program (eg if number of 
terminals is 0250 there are 3 terminal index records). The index is kept in     
line/terminal sequence. Each entry contains the following fields.

The first entry has a line id and terminal address of hex zeros, and points to  
a special terminal record which contains the system data ie. the average of all 
terminal record's data. Unused entries have a line id and terminal address of   
x'ff'. in addittion unusable entries at the end of the index have a disk address
of x'ff' (eg. if the number of terminals was specified as 0250 the first 250    
entries have pre-assigned disk addresses and the last 50 redundant entries have 
all x'ff').

The next group of records on the file are terminal records with a record type   
of x'01'. The 16 byte header is as follows. The LINE ID is the first 4 chrs     
of the LUID and the TERM ADDR is the last 4 chrs of the LUID. But if the        
STATUPDT progran runs with UPSI=XXXXX1XX the TERM ADDR is set to SPACES         
which groups the termonals by the first 4 chrs of the LUID.
