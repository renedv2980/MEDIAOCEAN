Returned block is 88 byte long.If A(return block) is zeroes the address of a    
block is returned in P1 from which values must be extracted immediately.  The   
address of GETFACT is passed in COMFACS (CGETFACT). As the length of the        
returned block is subject to increases in length it is recommended that         
the caller passes zero and extracts relevent fields from the returned           
area. The area is covered by FACTSD DSECT given by pan book FAFACTS.            
                                                                                
Extract calls:                                                                  
                                                                                
Fafacts now contains some extracts of useful system areas of FACPAK.            
ie UTL TCB SSB. It is possible to extract the whole block or single             
fields from these extracts.                                                     
                                                                                
Dsects labels of the extracted areas are as close to the original as            
possible except the first 2 chrs are always F@ ie TCBIOCNT is F@BIOCNT.         
                                                                                
Most of the F@---- dsect lables have a corresponding equate F#----              
which can be used to extract the individual field.

         L     R1,0(R1)                                                         
         USING F@UTLD,R1                                                        
                                                                                
In this case P1 bytes 1-3 should be zero as the F@UTLD block will expand        
with future anhancements and it would be unwise to use your own working         
storage.                                                                        
                                                                                
There are also a set of special calls that must be used to set values in        
FACPAK control blocks. This ensures that application code will continue         
to work if DESCTs change or control blocks move to special storage areas        
For example there is bit in the UTL that says this application can              
exceed max i/o count. So where there is special initialisation code the         
bit can be turn on before the code and then turned off afterwards. Calls        
to do this are as follows :                                                     
                                                                                
         GOTO1 VGETFACT,DMCB,(X'80',0),F#MIOST  Turn on can exceed i/os         
         ...                                                                    
         ...                                                                    
         GOTO1 VGETFACT,DMCB,(X'80',0),F#MIOUN  Turn off exceed i/os
