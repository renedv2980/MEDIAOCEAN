         TITLE 'MONVAL'                                                         
                                                                                
This routine can be used to validate period expressions that are                
   month related.                                                               
                                                                                
P1       A(Input expression)                                                    
P2       A(Output expression - XL4)                                             
         This can be preset to YMYM start-end                                   
            or cleared to binary zeros                                          
         After MONVAL this will contain derived YMYM                            
            or will contain zeros if in error

         MONVAL will validate anything that is not ambiguous.                   
         F is allowed for February;  but MA could be MAR or MAY.                
         If period is preset, MONVAL ensures that derived period will           
            fit within the bounds of the preset period.                         
         MONVAL checks that start is not after end.                             
         Wrap-around expressions (DEC-FEB/86 etc.) are considered               
            dangerous and are not allowed.
