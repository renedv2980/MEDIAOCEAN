         TITLE 'FASWITCH'                                                       
FASWITCH provides multi-system access for programs running under FACPAK.        
Only one system may be accessed at any one time. At user connect time           
the connect program builds a list of all systems that a user may potent-        
ially connect to. To switch to one of these systems use the following           
parameter list:-

After this call TWAACCS will contain the limit access value for the             
system that has been switched to.                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
To switch to a known system use the following parameter list:-

             1-3     A(256 byte system facility list) if facility list          
                     for system being switched to is required, or A(0)          
                     if facility list is not required                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
To clear down a switch list of systems that you are not interested in to        
make room for subsequent special FASWITCH calls to specific SE's                
                                                                                
P1   BYTE(S) 0       Set to X'FB' for delete action                             
             1-3     Set to X'FFFFFF' to show special call                      
                                                                                
P2   BYTE(S) 0       Set to X'00' to delete all systems or set to ov sys        
                     num of system you want to keep (eg X'06' for acc)          
             1-3     Not used                                                   
                                                                                
The X'FB' special delete call will ignore the first item in the switch          
list (the one to which the original =CT was made), and any system that          
has been active for recovery. If the caller passes X'00' in P2(1) all           
systems will be deleted. To keep the item for a given system pass the           
overlay system number in P2(1). The following code will delete all items        
in the switch list except the connected system and the Acc system entry.        
                                                                                
     GOTO1 CSWITCH,DMCB,X'FBFFFFFF',X'06000000'                                 
                                                                                
NOTE:The address of FASWITCH is passed in COMFACS at CSWITCH. Programs          
     must be authorised for system switching (else FASWITCH will die).          
     TWA0 is written to TEMPSTR for system checkpoint/restart when a            
     successful switch has been completed. All DATAMGR values for the           
     system being switched from are destroyed by FASWITCH (i.e. read            
     sequential sequence is broken etc.). FACPAK will always switch             
     back to the connected system after a transaction completes. Up to          
     12 systems may be switched to for update. A list of system names           
     follows:-
