Module will generate a list of compatible IDs from a terminal or ID record or a 
list of valid destination IDs from an ID record.

                             X'08'=read-only match if p1(1)=L or M              
               bytes 1-3     A(8 byte alpha or two byte binary userid)          
                                                                                
Parameter 5    byte 0        n/d                                                
               bytes 1-3     A(8 byte alpha synonym id if p3(1)=S)              
                                                                                
A normal call (p3(1)=X'00') causes GETIDS to build a list of userid             
names and numbers in a list that the caller processes after the call            
to GETIDS. A validation call is one where the caller passes a user id           
alpha or userid number and lets GETIDS validate if the passed value is          
valid or not. This is done by setting p3(1)=C'A', C'N', or C'S'                 
                                                                                
For a normal call the caller points to an output block in p2 or sets p2         
to 0 when an area in GETIDs working storage will be passed back in p2.          
Each entry in the output block contains the 10 byte alpha user ID (always) and  
the 2 byte binary user ID number (for destination ID list), the block entry is  
always 12 bytes long. For a new style call, p1(1)=L/M, the first 8 bytes        
contains the 8 byte alpha id, the next byte is X'00', and the next byte         
is a flag byte which has X'40'bit on if match was on a read-only id.            
                                                                                
After GETIDS parameter 1 byte 0 contains num of entries in the block or         
X'FF' if error. Parameter 2 byte zero set to zero if OK or errort type.         
Error types in P2 and the corresponding P1 error value are as follows:- g       
                                                                                
P1=X'FF' P2=X'01' Invalid parameter list.                                       
P1=X'00' P2=X'02' Deleted Id list record - record ignored.                      
P1=X'00' P2=X'04' Missing Id list record - record ignored.                      
P1=X'00' P2=X'08' Output block full.                                            
                                                                                
A normal validate call is done by seting HOB of Parameter 3 to C'A' or          
C'N' and setting in Parameter 4 the address of a CL8 alpha user id or           
an XL2 numeric user id number. Each userid (that would be put in the            
output block on a normal call) is compared with the passed value. If            
nothing matches an X'00' is returned in the HOB of Parameter 4. If the          
userid matches then X'01' is returned , or if ALL users is found in the         
record then GETIDS exits with a return value of X'02' in the HOB of             
Parameter 4. In this case p2 will be set to point to the address of a           
single entry list if the return value is X'01'. The return value will           
have the X'80' bit turned on if the match was on a read-only userid.            
                                                                                
A special validation call requires a C'S' to be set in p3(1) and p4 set         
to the address of a CL8 userid and p5 to be set to the address of a             
CL8 synonym value of the userid passed in p4. If there is no synonym            
userid point p5 to a CL8 containing nulls or spaces or set p5 to                
zeros. The special call does the same as a normal call (ie builds a             
list of userids) but if there is a wild card match entry in the record          
passed in p1 then an executed wild card match will be made on P4 and p5         
values. If we do a wild card match we exit with X'04' in p4(1) leaving          
the list we have build so far in p2. A wild card entry in the input             
record that does not match will not be expanded or put into the output          
list for the C'S' type call. It is just ignored. As above the X'80' bit         
will also be turned on if a read-only wild card matche was made.
