         TITLE 'UNSCAN'                                                         
This module is complementary to SCANNER.  A block of left aligned fields        
is converted to a string of continuous data separated by commas.  When          
fields have two operands, these are separated by equals sign.  Embedded         
blanks are permitted in either operand.                                         
                                                                                
Parameter 1    byte  0       Number of fields to be output if possible          
                             (null is acceptable)                               
                                                                                
               bytes 1-3     A(block) - see below                               
                                                                                
Parameter 2    byte  0       C'C'                                               
                             Non-zero = non-standard length of second           
                                        operand (default=10, max=60)            
               bytes 1-3     A(80 byte card area)                               
                                       or                                       
               bytes 0-4     A(screen field header)                             
                                                                                
Parameter 3                  Optional character substitution. If you            
                             fill parameter 3 with C',=XY'  the comma           
                             and equals in output will become X and Y.          
                                                                                
Parameter 4    byte  0       Non-zero = non-standard length of first            
                                        operand (default=10, max=60)            
                                        (note - bytes 1-3 must be defined       
                                         as shown or parameter is ignored.)     
               bytes 1-3     C'$LT'                                             
                                                                                
Block consists of twenty byte field entries.  The first 10 bytes contain the    
field or the first operand of a 2-operand field.  The second 10 bytes contain   
spaces or the second operand of a 2-operand field.
