In general, when you use DDS services, it is referred to as "using the system."
Specifically, though, there is more than one "system" involved.  For SPOTPAK   
media purposes, you will be using two separate "systems".

         HEAD0 'Copying Headline Information Automatically'                     
The 'Headline Copy' feature lets you switch between programs and display data  
immmediately without re-entering headline information.  The system             
automatically transfers similar headline information from the original program 
to the new program.                                                            
         SPACE 2                                                                
To change programs:                                                            
         SPACE 1                                                                
1.Tab to the Service Request field (at the top right of the screen) and       
         SPACE 1                                                                
2.Enter '+xxx', where 'xxx' is the new program identification.                
         SPACE 2                                                                
For example, to change from the Buy to the MIS program, tab the cursor to the  
Service Request field of the Buy program and enter +MIS. The MIS screen will   
appear with headline information automatically supplied from the Buy screen.   
To return to the Buy program, enter +BUY in the Service Request field of the   
MIS screen.                                                                    
One useful application for the feature is switching between Buy and MIS        
programs as described above.  You can instantly see the effect of input on your
overall buy status in MIS, or switch back to the Buy program to adjust your    
schedule, with a single command.  Since Buy and MIS require the same headline  
input, all headline information will be carried over and you can swap between  
'full' screens of data with the single command.                                
         SPACE 2                                                                
The feature can also save input when you change to programs that do not require
exactly the same headline input, but you will have to fill in the input fields 
that do not carry over.                                                        
         HEAD1 'Broadcast Messages'                                             
DDS sometimes sends out Broadcast Messages over the system to inform users of  
system problems, interruptions in service, and other service reminders.  If a  
broadcast message is sent while you are inputting, the message will interËrupt 
you the next time you hit ENTER--instead of receiving your normal screen of    
text, you will receive the broadcast message.  Hit ENTER again to return to    
your input screen.

To recall broadcast messages that have been sent during a day (if any), enter  
$RB in the Service Request field.

         HEAD1 'Restricted characters'                                          
Do not use colons (:) or semi-colons (;) within any description on the screen  
in a Spotpak program.  Percent signs (%) and number signs (#) may be entered   
online but will not print out on reports.                                      
         HEAD1 'Error Messages'                                                 
Instructions generally appear on the top of the screen.  In the event that the 
system detects an input error, an error message will appear instead.  If an    
error is detected, the system will refuse to accept your input, and the cursor 
will be positioned at the location of the error.                               
         SPACE 2                                                                
The system attempts to analyze the cause of errors and to point out the most   
likely cause.  The cause indicated may not be the actual cause, however, since 
the system cannot always guess your intent.  If an error message is unclear or 
seems not to make sense, review the input requirements for the field in        
question.  If no error is found, call DDS Client Service.                      
         HEAD1 'Program Failures'                                               
Occasionally, unanticipated input may result in a program failure.  If this    
happens, a special PROGRAM FAILURE screen will appear, alerting you to inform  
DDS of the failure.                                                            
         SPACE 2                                                                
If the screen returns a message that your input has called a program failure,  
do not repeat the transaction which caused the failure.  Call DDS Client     
Service immediately and report that a program failure has occurred.
