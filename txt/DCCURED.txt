         TITLE 'CURED'                                                          
                                                                                
           CURED provides EDIT facilities for any currency by building          
           a parameter list for and calling CUREDIT with reference to a         
           table of currencies built by BLDCUR.                                 
           (SEE DOBLDCUR)                                                       
                                                                                
(LABEL)  CURED INPUT,OUTPUT,CURR ENTRY(,MODADDR=CUREDIT)

               (,ZERO=BLANK)(,BRACKET=YES)(,CURSYMB=YES/SHORT)(,CR=YES)         
               (,DECS=NO)(,DECS=ROUND)(,FLOAT=-)(,TRAIL=)                       
               (,DECPNT=COUNTRY)                                                
                                                                                
INPUT      As for EDIT macro excluding TIME and DAY features. Labels may        
-----      be longer than 8 characters (eg. BILLABLE+4) and adcons              
           are accepted.                                                        
                                                                                
OUTPUT     OUTPUT or (L,OUTPUT) where L = 1 - 30 and may be a number,           
------     an equate or may be contained in a register.  When OUTPUT            
           is the address of an output area and L is not coded, then            
           L defaults to L'OUTPUT.  OUTPUT is addressed by a register           
           or is the address of the output area.                                
                                                                                
CURR ENTRY May be a register or adcon or the address of the CURRENCY            
---------- TABLE entry for this currency.(eg. ACURR1 (see DCBLDCUR))            
           If an integer is specified (or an equate name in quotes)             
           it will be interpreted as the number of decimal places and           
           will be inserted in a dummy currency table of all zeros.             
           TRAIL=x may be specified only if a numeric or equated name           
           is used in this parameter.                                           
                                                                                
MODADDR=   Passes the address of CUREDIT if this is not held in CUREDIT         
           as it is in MEREPWORKD.                                              
                                                                                
DMCB=      Passes address of a FULLWORD alternative to DMCB for the             
           parameter list passed to CUREDIT.                                    
                                                                                
CURSYMB=YES Causes this currency's symbol to be appended to the value           
           as a prefix or suffix as appropriate to the currency.                
                                                                                
CURSYMB=S  (SHORT) causes just the first character of the currency              
           symbol to be used as a prefix or suffix to the value.                
                                                                                
DECS=NO    Causes decimal places, if any, to be dropped.                        
                                                                                
DECS=ROUND Causes decimal places, if any, to be dropped and the value           
           to be rounded.                                                       
                                                                                
DECPNT=F   Causes a decimal point character before the decimal places           
           and the use of a comma character as the comma separator.             
                                                                                
           Other options are as for the EDIT macro.                             
                                                                                
Notes:     CURED uses registers R1, RE and RF.                                  
           Also, like EDIT, it returns the significant length in R0, if         
           ALIGN=LEFT is specified.
