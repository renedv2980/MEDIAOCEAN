In response to requests made at the recent CASHPAK and ACCPAK workshops, we are
adding two new features on the Cash Disbursement/Cleared But Undisbursed Report
(AC58):

         SPACE 1                                                                
 ù Reporting of summaries only                                               
         SPACE 3                                                                
Report Cash Disbursements for Multiple Months

You can now request the Cash Disbursement version of the AC58 for multiple     
months.  To report more than one month enter a month and year in the new 'END  
DATE' field.   For example:                                                    
         SPACE 1                                                                
END DATE :JUL/83                                                           
         SPACE 1                                                                
If you leave the field blank, the report will show data for the single month   
entered in the START DATE field.                                               
         SPACE 2                                                                
Report Summaries Only

You can now request the report to show summary information only.  If you use   
this option the report will include any client, media, or office summaries that
usually appear but will not show any payee-level detail.  To report summaries  
only, enter 'Y' in the new SUMMARIES ONLY? field.
