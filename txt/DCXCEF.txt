         TITLE 'XCEF and XCEFL'                                                 
Macro clears an area of core to binary zeros by generating a loop of XC         
instructions.                                                                   
NOTE: This macro uses RE and RF.                                                
                                                                                
There is a similar macro called XCEFL which clears the area by generating an    
MVCL instruction, rather than multiple XC instructions.                         
NOTE: This macro also uses R0 and R1 (in addition to RE and RF).                
                                                                                
Both XCEF and XCEFL accept identical parameters.                                
                                                                                
(NAME)   XCEF                                                                   
                                                                                
When 1st parameter is omitted, RE is assumed to have address of the area.       
When 2nd parameter is omitted, RF is assumed to have length of the area.        
                                                                                
Alternative versions of XCEF - Operands specify address of data                 
                               and the number of bytes to be cleared.           
                                                                                
(NAME)   XCEF                   RE = A(area), RF = L'(area)                     
(NAME)   XCEF  (Rx),(Ry)        Rx = A(area), Ry = L'(area)                     
(NAME)   XCEF  AREA,(Ry)        AREA is a relocatable symbol

(NAME)   XCEF  AREA,'SIZEQ'     SIZEQ is an absolute (EQUated) symbol           
(NAME)   XCEF  ,L'AREA          RE must be A(area)                              
(NAME)   XCEF  AREA,            RF must be L'(area)
