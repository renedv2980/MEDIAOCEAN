         TITLE 'SNAPPER'                                                        
                                                                                
DMSNAP is used to flag a file in the appropriate data manager data space        
that there is a snap shot copy of the file available for off line access        
                                                                                
DMSNAP is used to turn on the flags when the snap shop copies are to be         
used and to turn off the flags when offline jobs are to use the current         
live files again.                                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
The SYSIN input to DMSNAP has parameter cards to define :-                      
What data space to flag                                                         
Whether snapping is being turned on or off                                      
One card per file or system to define the files                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
The parameter cards are as follows                                              
                                                                                
DDSIO=........ To name a different DDSIO module from the standard one           
                                                                                
DSPACE=.       To name the data space (required card)                           
                                                                                
SNAP=Y         To turn on snapping or (required card)                           
SNAP=N         To turn off snapping                                             
                                                                                
FORCE=Y        Forces an override to the rules of snapping                      
OVERRIDE       Same as FORCE=Y                                                  
                                                                                
FILENAME       To name an individual file eg SPTFIL3                            
                                                                                
SYS=XXXX       To name all the files in system XXXX that are defined as         
               being snappable in their file definitions. XXXX is the           
               FOUR chr system name eg SPT1, ACC2, REP1, PRT2, etc              
                                                                                
DMSNAP must be run in each CPU where the snap shot of the files is to be        
defined. The correct data space must be named for each set of files and         
only one data space can be named for each exec. The data space chars are        
A for advertiser files, R for rep files, and T for test files.                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
Sample JCL and SYSIN as follows to turn on snapping for test files              
SPTDIR1, SPTFIL1, and all of the files that are defined to be snappable         
in SPT2. The OVERRIDE card will allow individual files to be defined as         
snappable even if their file definitions do not state that.
