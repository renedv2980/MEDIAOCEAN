         TITLE 'PANACEA'                                                        
Program is an extended version of PAN#1. All normal functions of PAN#1 are      
supported but special control cards that start with && in columns 1-2 generate  
automatic records on WORK.                                                      
                                                                                
Control cards can be included after ++UPDATE ++ADD or ++LEVEL on a PAN data     
set.  The data set name is used by PANACEA in its subsequent write.

  &&CATAL                      Causes a CATALR or CATALP function when a        
                               *CATALR reloname or *CATALP reloname             
                               is specified in source book.                     
  &&PHASE                      Causes object to be catalogued to the CIL with   
                               the phase name as specified in the source book.  
  &&PHASE TEST=A               Takes phase name from source book and appends    
                               TEST level character (A,B,C).                    
  &&PHASE phasename,origin     Causes execution of the assembly program         
                 (,NOAUTO)     with option CATAL and LNKEDT to CIL.             
                               Phasename overrides any phasename in source.     
  &&INCLUDE reloname(,CSECT)   Additional input after &&PHASE.  This causes     
                               reloname to be linked from the                   
                               relocatable library and not the PAN library,

  &&SET id1=n,id2=y            Can be a single card before an &&ASSEMBLY,       
                               &&CATAL or &&PHASE card to set variables.        
                               Can also be on the && action card at any         
                               position leaving at least 1 space after the      
                               action (e.g., ++DUMMY FRED,PHASE &&SET KEN=Y).   
                               Note that if an &&SET is present on the ++DUMMY  
                               card, the module will be unpromotable via PanAPT.

If you are not updating a book but wish to cause one of the PANACEA functions   
to take place, you need only one card and don't need to know the level number.  
                                                                                
     ++DUMMY bookname,function                                                  
                                                                                
Function can be any one of the valid && commands above with && removed.

 Notes                                                                          
 -----                                                                          
                                                                                
If a valid &&card is processed by PANACEA it will be replaced by one or more    
input cards with the action name in cols 73-80.  If an invalid &&card is        
detected it (and all subsequent related &&cards) will be printed with the word  
DELETED and a PANACEA error message.  All generated PAN commands are            
conditional (--).                                                               
                                                                                
If a PANACEA function is required on a book that is not being updated, use a    
'++DUMMY' card (see above).                                                     
                                                                                
Link edit statements can be catalogued at the very beginning of a source book.  
This will cause PANACEA to include these statements automatically in the        
linkedit decks unless overridden by an &&card.  These must have an asterisk in  
column 1, the linkedit statement starting in column 2. (Example *INCLUDE FRED.) 
These statements add to documentation and are used by the XREF program.         
                                                                                
If book name starts with 'LK', the individual linkedit statements are printed   
to show sequence numbers.  If the link book is catalogued with BAL format, then 
level number will also appear.

There are three standard conditions set automatically.                          
In the US they are  ALL=Y,US=Y,UK=N.                                            
In the UK they are  ALL=Y,UK=Y,US=N.                                            
                                                                                
If a conditional name is encountered that has not been defined by a &&SET or a  
*&&SET statement, its value is assumed to be that of ALL.  in other words, all  
unknown conditional cards will be included unless ALL=N.                        
                                                                                
A conditional name has a max of 5 characters.                                   
                                                                                
                                                                                
*&&UK*&& text           If UK=N this card will be left as a comment.            
                        If UK=Y cols 1-8 become spaces, 70-71 become UK.        
                                                                                
Conditional variables can be set by the &&SET statement in PANACEA or           
programatically as follows-                                                     
                                                                                
*&&FRED  SET   Y        Single statement                                        
*&&      SET   A=Y,B=N  Multiple statement                                      
                                                                                
A SET statement can be acted upon within the scope of another SET variable-     
                                                                                
*&&FRED                                                                         
*&&JIM   SET   Y        Will set JIM=Y if FRED=Y                                
*&&                                                                             
                                                                                
If any *&& statement has invalid syntax, the * in col 1 will be removed,        
causing a syntax error.                                                         
                                                                                
*&& conditions can be nested up to 4 levels deep.                               
                                                                                
&&PON and &&GEN parameters in assemblies                                        
----------------------------------------                                        
You can add one of the above parameters to the end of your ++DUMMY card         
when running a PANA (assembly only).  &&PON will cause any PRINT OFF            
cards to be disabled (by placing *PON in column 1 of that line, making          
it a comment.)  &&GEN disables PRINT NOGEN cards (by placing *GEN in            
column 1.)  These parameters allow you to alter the output of an                
assembly without editing your pan book.                                         
                                                                                
*PREFIX cards in assemblies                                                     
---------------------------                                                     
There are occasions (especially when including dsects from multiple             
systems) when included dsects have valid duplicate labels.  Using               
*PREFIX cards you can change the labels of one of the dsects, thereby           
eliminating your "previously defined" assembly errors.                          
                                                                                
To use this feature place a *PREFIX=xxx(=nnnnnnnnnn) card immediately           
before the ++include of the dsect you want to alter.  xxx is a 1-3 character    
prefix which will be inserted before all labels until a *PREFIX= (with nothing  
on rhs of = sign) is encountered.  If you include a pan book which itself       
includes other panbooks, then you can specify which second level included       
panbook you want the prefix to operate on by specifying the name in the         
optional parameter =nnnnnnnnnn.  The = sign must be in column 12, regardless    
of how long your prefix is.                                                     
                                                                                
An example:                                                                     
*PREFIX=A$
