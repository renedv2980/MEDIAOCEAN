Introduction                                                                    
------------                                                                    
   This document describes how a run time TRACE of FACPAK SCRIPTS               
can be configured and reviewed. In general script traces are set up in          
association with the existing FACPAK TSTTAB entry id and record                 
information for each script command as processed durring the execution          
of the script.                                                                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
1) FACPAK configuration.                                                        
                                                                                
Each entry in the TSTTAB can be optionally allocated an area for                
script tracing. This is defined by its size in the FAPARMDEF parameter          
FACSCT. If this is set to '0' FACPAK configures as usual and no script          
tracing is possible. Otherwise the value is used by FASTART to allocate         
an area of memory 'above the line'. Since each Script command requires          
about 300 bytes for tracing then 'FACSCT=300000' will give you '1000'           
possible entries in the script trace.                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
2) Script language commands                                                     
                                                                                
There are 2 commands associated with Script tracing                             
                                                                                
a) SCTON - This indicates to the script controller - FASCRUNCH - to             
TURN ON Script tracing at this point in the script execution                    
b) SCTOFF - Likewise this indicates TURN OFF Script tracing here.               
                                                                                
These commands can be used repeatedly throughout the script,                    
for example to limit the trace to certain suspect parts of the script.          
NOTE: The FIRST SCTON command MUST FOLLOW a previous IAMS/IAMI                  
command and the FIRST program Connect command which establishes the             
the TSTTAB id to be used with this script.                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
3) Internal mechanisms and data areas                                           
                                                                                
The information in the Script trace buffer is structured on the                 
basis of the DSECT FASCTTAB. This covers a general Header area at               
the start of the Buffer followed by an entry for each script                    
command processed in sequence.                                                  
The Trace information is written to the Buffer by the Script                    
execution controller FASCRUNCH. When the buffer is full the                     
process wraps back round to the start of the buffer and continues,              
overwriting the first entries recorded.                                         
                                                                                
      EJECT                                                                     
                                                                                
4) =SCT Script trace report                                                     
                                                                                
Script traces can be viewed online with the Service request =SCT. This          
program is modelled on code copied from the existing IO TRACE sevice            
request =TRACE, in the unlikely event you are familiar with this.               
(NOTE: Ordinary IO Tracing and TWA tracing are also still possible              
when configured with Script executions, as before - see script                  
commands TRON and TROFF.)                                                       
=SCT is only valid on FACPAK TEST systems.                                      
                                                                                
a) Commands:                                                                    
                                                                                
Sevice request field:                                                           
i)   '=SCT,TSTI'. Optionally first time in specify the ID of your               
TSTTAB buffer, else defaults to the TEST BUFFER to which you are                
currently connected. TSTI is a valid TSTTAB id of upto 4 characters.            
                                                                                
Parameter 1:                                                                    
i)   'I=TESTID'. Optionally first time in specify the ID of your TSTTAB         
buffer, else defaults to the TEST BUFFER to which you are currently             
connected. Otherwise it will prompt you with the error message:                 
                                                                                
      ****ERROR****NOT CONNECTED TO A TEST BUFFER.                              
                                                                                
In this case enter the I= with the TESTID you use. e.g. I=JOMU.                 
                                                                                
ii)  'I' . As above, but enter TESTID in parameter 2.                           
                                                                                
iii) NUMBER. Optionally enter number of first entry to display,                 
defaults to first entry in script trace buffer.                                 
Note that trace may have reached end of buffer and subsequently                 
'wrapped round' to the start so number may be non-zero.                         
                                                                                
iv)  'P' . Print out buffer. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.                               
                                                                                
Parameter 2:                                                                    
i)   'X' . Optionally specify 'Extended' display, else defaults to              
'normal' display. (See below.) This value needs to be re-entered after          
every display if required.                                                      
                                                                                
ii) 'TESTID' . Specify TSTTAB test as above, with 'I' in parameter 1.           
                                                                                
                                                                                
      EJECT                                                                     
b) Display:                                                                     
                                                                                
i) Normal display:                                                              
                                                                                
  This is an approximate copy of a typical =SCT screen display                  
  requested in default non-extended mode.                                       
  3 entries are shown per screen. Each entry has 4 lines of display.            
  Numbers in left column refer to key descriptions below.
