The SOFDAT module handles both soft and hard date expressions.  Soft            
dates can be defined for each DDS mainframe system.  For the ACCPAK             
system there are extra expressions for fiscal periods (based on company         
financial periods as opposed to calendar periods) - see below for a             
full list of keywords.  Hard dates are validated using PERVAL.                  
                                                                                
A soft date is a date that gets resolved at program execution time              
instead of the user having to specify a hard date when making a request.        
For instance, if the user wants to run a report for the previous                
calendar month he can input the following expression:  !SPM-EPM (start          
of previous month to end of previous month) - if the request were to            
run in January the returned dates would be for December of the previous         
year.  The best use of soft dates is when adding requests to an RFP             
group, this enables users to set up reports to run without having to            
change any dates in the requests before execution (as long as the               
request period can be expressed softly).                                        
                                                                                
There are three types of call to SOFDAT: validation, resolution and             
conversion:-                                                                    
                                                                                
Validation calls                                                                
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                                
Validation calls (SOFITYM and SOFITYMD) are passed one or two                   
TWA field header addresses (two if a period field is split into                 
start and end date fields) - the following indicators may also                  
be set in SOFIINDS:-                                                            
                                                                                
SOFIISFT - Validate soft date expressions (if not set on soft dates             
           won't be allowed)                                                    
                                                                                
SOFIIHRD - Validate hard date expressions (if not set on hard dates             
           won't be allowed) - PERVAL is used to validate hard dates            
                                                                                
SOFIIANY - Allow both soft and hard date expressions                            
                                                                                
SOFIIONE - Validate a single date (if not set on period is assumed)             
                                                                                
SOFIIF1O - Start date is optional. If this bit is set on periods where          
           the start date isn't given (eg !-ECW) will result in the             
           output start date being returned as spaces (or X'00's - see          
           SOFIISLH below), if off the start date is required.                  
                                                                                
SOFIIF2O - End date is optional.  If this bit is set on periods where           
           the end date isn't given (eg !ECW-) will result in the               
           output end date being returned as spaces (or X'FF's - see            
           SOFIISLH below), if off the end date is required.                    
                                                                                
SOFIISLH - Will return X'00's in the start date output field where              
           the start date hasn't been specified and X'FF's in the               
           end date output field where the end date hasn't been                 
           specified instead of spaces.                                         
                                                                                
SOFIIRES - Will return actual dates from a validation call instead              
           of soft date expression(s) in the caller's output area.              
                                                                                
SOFIIOUT - Will output expanded dates in the input field(s) where               
           the user has input a shortened hard date expression                  
           (eg if '98' was input for a YMD period, 01JAN98-31DEC98              
           would be returned).                                                  
                                                                                
After validation the caller should first check for errors.  SOFDAT              
sets the condition code on exit to equal if there are no errors else            
not equal with the field SOFERROR containing the error number.  The             
SOFEINDS field may have either SOFEIF1E or SOFE1F2E set on also to              
indicate which date is in error (1E for start date, 2E for end date).           
                                                                                
The output from a validation call can be either a soft or hard date             
in one of seven formats: 8 (or 4) byte EBCDIC (YYMMYYMM), 12 (or 6)             
byte EBCDIC (YYMMDDYYMMDD), 4 (or 2) byte compressed (YYMMDDYYMMDD),            
2 (or 4) byte PWOS (YYMMYYMM), 3 (or 6) byte PWOS (YYMMDDYYMMDD),               
2 (or 4) byte binary (YYMMYYMM) or 3 (or 6) byte binary (YYMMDDYYMMDD).         
                                                                                
The output format is controlled by the SOFOTYPE field which must be             
set by the caller.  Soft dates are always returned right aligned in             
the output area (see below for soft date output format) and padded              
with binary zeroes from the left.  Hard dates are returned in whatever          
format the caller requested.  The following bits can be tested by               
the caller in SOFOINDS:                                                         
                                                                                
SOFOISFT - User input a soft date expression                                    
                                                                                
SOFOIHRD - User input a hard date expression                                    
                                                                                
SOFOIF1I - Start date given                                                     
                                                                                
SOFOIF2I - End date given                                                       
                                                                                
SOFOINOI - No input (only set if SOFIIF1O or SOFIIf2O set and nothing           
           input - output period will be spaces)                                
                                                                                
The caller may also specify the maximum period that is allowed                  
which causes an error to be generated if exceeded.  To do this                  
set the field SOFMAXPT to SOFMYEAR, SOFMMNTH or SOFMDAY to                      
indicate whether the field SOFMAXPV is a number of years, months                
or days.  The fields SOFOVDIP, SOFOVMIP and SOFOVYIP are always                 
set to the number of days, months and years in the request period               
(for those of you who want to do the checking yourselves) and                   
the fields SOFOVSTD and SOFOVEND always contain the resolved dates              
in 6 byte EBCDIC format (even if the output is a soft date).  Maximum           
period checking is not carried out when validating a single expression.

Having called SOFDAT to validate an input expression where a soft date          
expression was used you will need to call SOFDAT again at execution             
time to resolve the dates into the correct format for processing.  The          
input to this function is the output from the validation call with the          
correct input type set (SOFITYPE must be set to SOFITSD1, SOFITSD2 or           
SOFITSD3).  The output from it is a hard date or period.  The output            
area address may be set to binary zeroes for this call and if so the            
dates will be resolved into the input area replacing the soft date              
expression (useful for resolving a soft period in a request card).

As an internal soft date expression is non-printable SOFDAT has a               
function that converts it into its original input format.  The                  
input to this function is a soft date or period expression and                  
the output is one or two TWA fields.  After calling the conversion              
routine the input field length is set to the length of the output               
data and the transmit bit is set on in the field header(s).  If a               
period field is to be output into two TWA fields the second TWA                 
field header address must be passed in SOFAOUT2.  This function also            
works for hard dates - an extra indicator bit (SOFOTPYM) may be set             
to indicate that the printable format for a hard date is year/month             
instead of year/month/day - this need not be set where the input                
date doesn't carry the day (SOFITSD1, SOFITSD4 and SOFITSD6).

Soft date expressions always start with the ! character followed by             
a code representing the date (eg !CM = current month).  Some expressions        
may be suffixed with a sign and number which modifies the year (eg !CM-1        
= current month last year, !CM+1 = current month next year).  For period        
fields complex expressions may be input (eg !NM-1-CM+1 or !NM-1-!CM+1           
next month last year to current month next year).  Open periods may be          
used if the relevent indicator bits are set (SOFIIF1O/SOFIIF2O) - eg            
!-ECW (optional start date), !ECW- (optional end date).
