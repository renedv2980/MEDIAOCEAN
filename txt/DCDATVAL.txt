         TITLE 'DATVAL'                                                         
Validates variable length date expressions. The routine has been changed        
to support the year 2000 by considering years 00 thru 27 to mean 2000           
thru 2027, and to return a flag if a 21st century date is passed. The           
1st year byte is set to X'FA' to show 1st decade of 21st century, and           
1st year byte is set to X'FB' to show 2nd decade of 21st century  etc.          
                                                                                
Parameter 1  byte  0    0=validate for m/d/y (US) d/m/y (UK)                    
                        1=validate for m/d (US) d/m (UK)                        
                          (year is set to 00)                                   
                          some programs rely on this - do not change            
                        2=validate for m/y                                      
                        3=validate for day                                      
             bytes 1-3  A(input string - max lengh 12 chrs)                     
                                                                                
Parameter 2  byte  0    X'80' dont return new 21st century dates.               
             bytes 1-3  A(6-byte output area) - EBCDIC C'YYMMDD' format         
                        Set to C'000000' is input is invalid.                   
After DATVAL                                                                    
------------                                                                    
Parameter 1  bytes 0-3  Fullword len of valid field - zeros if invalid.         
Parameter 2  byte  0    X'40' if input is a 21st century date                   
                                                                                
Acceptable Data                                                                 
---------------                                                                 
Months can be 3-byte alpha form or 1-2 bytes numeric. Most input styles         
are supported but assumed maximum length of field cannot exceed 12 chrs.        
                                                                                
DATVAL will except dates in the range 1900 thru 2027. If a two digit            
year number is input the years 00 thru 27 will be assumed to be 2000            
thru 2027, and the years 28 thru 99 will be assumed to be 1928 thru 1999        
The years 1900 thru 1927 are supported only if input with the leading 19        
                                                                                
DATVAL will return an X'40' bit in PLIST+4 if a 21st century date has           
been specifically input (eg 2002) or assumed (eg 02).                           
                                                                                
Unless the caller sets PLIST+4 to X'80' if a 21st century date is input         
DATVAL will return in the first byte a non-numeric year code X'FA' thru         
x'FF' which represent the first five decades of the year 2000. This will        
ensure that the output dates collate.This special format is supported           
by all other DDS date routines where a C'YYMMDD' date is passed as a            
parameter.                                                                      
                                                                                
To process new style dates following code can be used
