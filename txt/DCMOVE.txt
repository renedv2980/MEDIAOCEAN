         TITLE 'MOVE'                                                           
Macro will MOVE characters where length exceeds 256 characters and may be       
variable.                                                                       
                                                                                
(Name)   MOVE  (fielda,length),fieldb                                           
                                                                                
Fielda                  May be a label or base and/or displacement.             
Length                  May be a register or an integer.                        
Fieldb                  May be a label or base and/or displacement.             
                                                                                
 Register Usage                                                                 
 --------------                                                                 
                                                                                
RF is used for fielda - passing A(fielda) in RF saves an instruction.           
R1 is used for length - passing length in R1 saves an instruction.              
RE is used for fieldb - passing A(fieldb) in RE saves an instruction.           
                                                                                
         MOVE  ((RF),(R1)),(RE) is thus most efficient.
