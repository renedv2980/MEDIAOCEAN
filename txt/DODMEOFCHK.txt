         TITLE 'DMEOFCHK'                                                       
                                                                                
This module is included in DMDDSIO and can be called with =V(DMEOFCHK)          
from any offline program that includes DMDMGRL. It can also be called           
via DATAMGR with C'EOFCHK' as the command in DMCBW1.                            
                                                                                
It is called passing a 7/8 chr direct access file name (e.g. ACCMST1).          
                                                                                
The routine searches the various tables of files that are part of               
data manager looking for a match on the file name passed in Param2.             
If a match is found an info block of relevent data is passed back.              
This is defined by the PAN book DMDDNAMED shown below. The most relevent        
piece of data is usually the SE Number which is defined by DDNASENO.            
DANASENO is at +1(1) in the return area.

Param3+0(1) Return X'10' if file not found or error in EOF checking             
Param3+1(3) Return A(Control block defined by DMDDNAMED)                        
                                                                                
Param2 contains the address of an 8-byte area containing a file name.           
The file is located by searching SYSFLES in data manager. An error is           
returned if the file is not found. If the file is not open DMEOFCHK will        
open the file. If the end-of-file has not been located (DNEXT=0) then           
the file is searched to located the end-of-file.                                
                                                                                
The EOF check is performed by reading the current value of DNEXT. This          
record must be found or an error is returned. The next part of the check        
is to read the next record on the same track as DNEXT. This record              
should not exist. If it does an error is returned. Then the first record        
on the next track is read. This record should not exist. If it does an          
error is returned in DMCBW2 and the error number is returned in the             
DDNAFINF field at DDNADATA+11.
