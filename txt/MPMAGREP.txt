<t>READERSHIP ANALYSIS REPORTS - INTRODUCTION                                   
There are five basic report types-                                              
                                                                                
   COMPARE - Vehicle comparison. Analyses individual vehicle delivery           
             against one or more targets. It is a useful tool for               
             selecting the most-cost efficient vehicles.                        
                                                                                
   REACH   - Reach extrapolation. Shows how reach builds across                 
             multiple issues of individual vehicles.                            
                                                                                
   VXV     - Vehicle x vehicle grid. This report provides, in a grid            
             format, the delivery of all possible pairs of a set of             
             vehicles.                                                          
                                                                                
   FREQ    - Frequency distribution report. A detailed display of the           
             frequency distribution that results from a given schedule.         
             An n-tile analysis can be optionally included.                     
                                                                                
   EVAL    - Schedule evaluation. A general purpose report primarily            
             directed toward providing the reach of a print media               
             schedule. A FREQ report can be generated at the same               
             time.                                                              
                                                                                
  Each of these reports will receive a detailed discussion later. This          
section is intended to provide an overall picture of how they are               
requested and to describe in detail the common controls and options.            
                                                                                
~PROGRAMS/REQUESTS                                                              
                                                                                
  Firstly, for each report type you can create a 'program' which                
contains the full range of report options. This program can be                  
cataloged and subsequently invoked as you actually make a request.              
When you do that, the entire program is displayed on the screen and             
you can ammend it or add to it as you see fit for this particular               
request. Programs may be left incomplete; you need not include all the          
necessary details when you catalog them. For instance, you might                
specify all the format options but leave the target and vehicle fields          
blank, to be filled in each time you use the program.                           
                                                                                
~SELECTING VEHICLES/SCHEDULES FOR THE REPORT                                    
                                                                                
  Vehicles are selected for the COMPARE, VXV, AND REACH reports                 
by specifying a schedule code. All vehicles in the schedule will                
be analysed in the report. The schedule will be considered as a                 
set of vehicles, not a set of insertions. 'Schedules' can be set up             
very quickly without any insertion detail, in which case they are               
merely lists of vehicles.                                                       
                                                                                
  For the EVAL report you also specify a schedule code. This time,              
however, the schedule is treated as a set of insertions.                        
                                                                                
  In both cases overrides that appear in the schedule, such as cost,            
imp adjustment, and circulation adjustment, will be incorporated in the         
report.                                                                         
                                                                                
~DATA ITEMS                                                                     
                                                                                
  The readership research reports feature a simple yet very flexible            
way for the user to specify the actual data to appear on the report.            
For selection purposes each item of data is broken down into two                
components- a base and a qualifier.  Depending on the report format,            
each item generates either a column or a row of data.  A few examples           
will illustrate the principle-                                                  
                                                                                
      BASE-                  QUALIFIER-                                         
                                                                                
      Average frequency      Index                                              
      Cumulative reach       % of target population                             
      Cumulative reach       % of total reach                                   
      CPM                    Rank                                               
                                                                                
  Each base and qualifier has a code that is easy to understand and             
remember.  Part of the documentation for each report is a table                 
showing what bases and qualifiers are available and in what                     
combinations. Data items are entered in the data selection fields of            
each program and request screen. Generally they will appear on the              
report in the order entered.                                                    
                                                                                
  The following rules apply for the formation of data items.                    
                                                                                
    1. A data item consists of a base and a qualifier- BASE(Q).                 
                                                                                
    2. Multiple qualifiers may given for the same base- BASE(Q1,Q2).            
       This generates multiple data items and therefore multiple                
       columns or rows on the report.                                           
                                                                                
    3. If a base is stated with no qualifiers, it is assumed to                 
       have 'count' (#) as its sole qualifier- BASE = BASE(#).                  
                                                                                
       Note, however, that # is never assumed as a qualifier if                 
       any other qualifiers are explicitly stated.                              
                                                                                
    4. REPEAT as a qualifier will cause all the qualifiers of the               
       previous base to be repeated for this one- RCH(REPEAT).                  
                                                                                
    5. Preceding the base by a '+' indicates-                                   
                                                                                
         a. on FREQ reports -that the data is to be weighted using              
                             the frequency weight scheme specified              
                             for the report.                                    
                                                                                
         b. on all other    -that the data is to be adjusted using              
            reports          any imp adjustment weights present.                
                             Only data that reflects numbers of people          
                             or numbers of exposures can be 'adjusted'.         
                                                                                
       Note- Imp adjustment weights, if used, are always reflected on           
             the FREQ report.  Reader weights (in-home, out-of-home,            
             primary, etc), if used, are always applied thoughout the           
             report.                                                            
                                                                                
    6. Each data item has a default display precision which can be              
       overridden by following the qualifier by a '/' and the desired           
       precision. Precision expressions are best explained by example-          
                                                                                
          000     = thousands                                                   
            0     = units                                                       
          .00     = hundredths                                                  
         .000     = thousandths                                                 
        000.0     = thousands to 1 decimal place                                
                    (124,600 = 124.6 thousandths)                               
~WEIGHTS                                                                        
                                                                                
  Survey weights and target component weights are described in the              
main chapter on weights. Three additional kinds of weights are                  
involved in the readership research reports.                                    
                                                                                
  A. Reader         You can weight persons according to what kind of            
     Weights.       reader they are- in-home, out-of-home, primary,             
                    secondary. This is specified in an RDRWGT= option           
                    on the program or request screen.                           
                                                                                
  B. Impression     Each publication (or insertion) may have an                 
     adjustment     impression adjustment weight. This is used to               
     weights.       reflect the planner's judgement that certain                
                    vehicles are more or less effective than others as          
                    an environment for particular advertising directed          
                    at a particular target.                                     
                                                                                
                    Imp weights are carried on schedules.                       
                                                                                
  C. Frequency      Individuals can also be weighted according to the           
     Weights.       number of times they are exposed to the advertising.        
                    They allow you to discount, either partially or             
                    entirely, people not exposed a sufficient number            
                    of times for the advertising to have had any                
                    impact. You can also discount people with a too             
                    high rate of exposure.

The list will start with this program code, or at                               
the beginning if you leave the field blank.

The id code acts as a filter.                                                   
                                                                                
  If the filter you enter is preceeded by an '=' the target id is               
compared to it starting at position one. *'s may be used to suppress            
filtering on the positions where they occur.                                    
                                                                                
  e.g.- a filter of =AB will list all targets with id's starting with           
        'AB'.                                                                   
        =**AB will pass all those with 'AB' in positions 3 and 4.               
                                                                                
  If the filter is not preceeded by an '=' all targets with ids                 
containing the filter string in any position will be listed.                    
                                                                                
  e.g.- a filter of ABC will pass all those with 'ABC' anywhere in the          
        id field.

** This report is only very roughly sketched out. No attempt                    
   has been made yet to address a number of significant                         
   programming considerations, particularly having to do with                   
   column annotation.

You can have the frequency levels grouped any                                   
way you wish.  Any level not specifically                                       
covered in the grouping statement will appear                                   
individually on the report. If there is no                                      
grouping statement, all levels will appear                                      
individually.                                                                   
                                                                                
Grouping statements are of the form-                                            
SS(NN),SS(NN),SS+, where SS is the starting

If you wish an n-tile analysis of the                                           
frequency distribution, enter here the number                                   
of divisions, e.g. 3 for terciles or 5 for                                      
quintiles.

  The schedule evaluation report is a general purpose report primarily          
directed toward providing the reach of a print media schedule. A FREQ           
report can be generated at the same time.

** This report is only very roughly sketched out. No attempt                    
   has been made yet to address a number of significant                         
   programming considerations, particularly having to do with                   
   column annotation.
