*        AGXREACT contains the code L for all records when a load     *         
*        mode extract is performed. All records in the database will  *         
*        be replaces by the extracted file.                           *         
*                                                                     *         
*        For an update mode extract, GXRECACT contains C (change),    *         
*???     A (add) or D (delete) for all records EXCEPT MONEY RECORDS.  *         
*???...  MONEY RECORDS CONTAIN M (MERGE). THE CONTENTS OF A MERGED    *         
*        RECORD ARE ADDED TO THE EXISTING RECORD OF THE SAME KEY, OR  *         
*        ADDED AS A NEW RECORD IF THE KEY DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST. IF  *         
*        THE RESULT OF ADDING THE CONTENTS TO AN EXISTING RECORD IS   *         
*        A RECORD WITH ALL ZERO VALUES, IT CAN THEN BE DELETED. FOR   *         
*        AN ADD, ONE POSITIVE MERGE RECORD IS CREATED. FOR A DELETE,  *         
*        AN IDENTICAL RECORD IS CREATED, BUT WITH ALL VALUES NEGATED. *         
*        FOR A CHANGE, TWO RECORDS ARE CREATED - A NEGATIVE DELETE OF *         
*        THE OLD VALUES AND A POSITIVE ADD OF THE NEW VALUES. THESE   *         
*        MAY BE COMBINED IF THE KEYS ARE THE SAME.                    *
