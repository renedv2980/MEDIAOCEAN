*  1) YOU MAY PROVIDE UP TO MINMAXB CONTIGUOUS IO BUFFERS. EACH BUFFER          
*     MUST BE MINFRCLM BYTES LONG.                                              
*                                                                               
*  2) MINIO KEEPS A TABLE OF RECORD INFORMATION. EACH ENTRY IS MINEKL+6         
*     BYTES LONG. AN ERROR IS RETURNED IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH             
*     SPACE FOR YOUR FILE.                                                      
*                                                                               
*  3) MINIO RETURNS THE REQUESTED CLUSTER IN THIS AREA. AN ERROR IS             
*     RETURNED IF A CLUSTER IS TOO LARGE. FOR ADDS OR WRITES THE USER           
*     SETS THE COMPLETE CLUSTER IN THIS AREA.                                   
*                                                                               
*  4) ALL ELEMENTS HAVING CODES WITHIN THIS RANGE ARE SUBSIDIARY                
*     ELEMENTS WITHIN A CLUSTER HEADED BY A 'KEY' ELEMENT. SUCH                 
*     ELEMENTS ARE NEVER RETURNED INDIVIDUALLY, ONLY AS PART OF THE             
*     CLUSTER.                                                                  
*                                                                               
*  5) IF MINFILTL IS NON-ZERO, THE HIGH, SEQ, AND BSEQ ACTIONS COMPARE          
*     ON THAT MANY BYTES OF THE ELEMENT KEY. WHEN AN UNEQUAL CONDITION          
*     IS FOUND, END-OF FILE IS RETURNED. THIS SAVES THE CALLER HAVING           
*     TO DO THE COMPARE HIMSELF.                                                
*                                                                               
*  6) IF MINMKCLC IS NON-ZERO, THE MASTER KEY IS COMPARED FOR ONLY              
*     THAT MANY BYTES AND THE FIRST MATCHING RECORD SET IS PROCESSED.           
*     THE KEY OF THE FF RECORD OF THE SET IS PLACED IN MINMKEY.                 
*                                                                               
*  7) IF MINMULTB IS NON-ZERO, THE ONE-BITS IN IT ARE SET ON IN THE             
*     FIRST OF THE STATUS BYTES OF THE FF RECORD, IF THE MINIO RECORD           
*     SET HAS MORE THAN ONE RECORD. OTHERWISE, THE BITS ARE SET OFF.            
*                                                                               
*  8) IN BUFFER MODE MINIO IS USED TO MAINTAIN A CORE BUFFER OF ELEMS.          
*     NO FILE READING OR WRITING IS INVOLVED. SET MINFRCLM TO THE FULL          
*     BUFFER LENGTH. MINNBUF WILL BE SET TO 1 AND MINRDUP TO N.                 
*                                                                               
*  9) THE DESTINATION FILE OF A COPY CAN BE OVERRIDDEN TO BE DIFFERENT          
*     TO THE CONNECTED FILE. HOWEVER BOTH FILES MUST HAVE THE SAME              
*     FORMAT.                                                                   
*     EG. TO COPY FROM MBAFIL TO MBUFIL WHILST CONNECTED TO MBA, SET            
*     THE COPY TO FILE/DIR (MINCTFIL/DIR) TO MBUFIL/DIR.                        
*     IF THE AGENCY ID CHANGES BETWEEN THE TWO FILES, THEN MINCTAGC             
*     SHOULD BE SET TO THE 'TO' AGENCY ID (OR NULLS) AND MINCTAGD SET           
*     TO THE DISPLACEMENT INTO THE FILE KEY THAT MINCTAGC SHOULD BE             
*     PLACED.                                                                   
*
