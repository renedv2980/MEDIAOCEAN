* NOTES REGARDING THE USE OF THE "OFFSET":                                      
* THESE ARE DEFAULT OFFSETS TO DEMO CATEGORY NUMBERS. THEY ARE                  
* REFERENCED IN BOTH THE SEXTAB AND AGETAB TABLES.                              
*                                                                               
* DEIS' THEORY: THE ORIGINAL DESIGN HEARKENS BACK TO THE DAY WHEN THERE         
* WAS A FIXED SET OF AGE CATEGORIES, EACH OF WHICH EXISTED FOR ALL 3            
* SEX CATEGORIES (W, M, V). MORE IMPORTANT: EACH AGE CATEGORY COULD BE          
* FOUND AT THE SAME RELATIVE DISPLACEMENT FROM THE FIRST AGE CATEGORY           
* OF ITS SEX CATEGORY. E.G.: AGE RANGE 12-20 EXISTS FOR WOMEN, MEN, AND         
* VIEWERS, AND IN EACH CASE, IS THE 3RD DEMO FROM THE START OF ITS SEX          
* CATEGORY LIST WITHIN THE FULL 256-CATEGORY TABLE.                             
*                                                                               
* SO DEMOVAL'S SEARCH OF SEXTAB IS CRITICAL, BECAUSE WHEN IT FINDS A            
* MATCHING ENTRY FOR THE GIVEN AGE RANGE, WE PICK UP THE DEMO CATEGORY          
* NUMBER FROM WHICH TO START COUNTING (I.E., THE "OFFSET"). IF THE              
* OFFSET IS ZERO, THAT MEANS THAT WHEN WE LOOK IN AGETAB, THE GIVEN             
* CATEGORY NUMBER WILL BE THE ACTUAL NUMBER (NOT OFFSET BY ANYTHING).           
*
