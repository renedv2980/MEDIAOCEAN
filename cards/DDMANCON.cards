         DSCTPTP IS A TAPE COPY UTILITY PROGRAM WHICH READS NO CONTROL          
STATEMENTS.  IT WILL COPY ANY TAPE WITH A BLOCK SIZE NOT GREATER THAN           
31,999 BYTES.  THE PARTITION SIZE ALLOCATED MUST BE AT LEAST EQUAL TO           
THE TAPE BLOCK SIZE PLUS 2,000 BYTES.  MULTI-FILE VOLUME(S) MAY BE              
COPIED BY PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE UPSI CONTROL STATEMENT.  MULTIPLE           
UPSI SWITCH SETTINGS MAY BE USED TO COMBINE FUNCTIONS OF DSCTPTP.               
INPUT IS READ ON SYS004, OUTPUT IS PRODUCED ON SYS005.  DSCTPTP

DMLDMOD IS A GENERALISED CONTROLLER MODULE FOR FILE MAINTENANCE FUNCTIONS ON A  
PAIR OF FILES. THE PAIR OF FILES COMPRISE A FIXED LENGTH INDEX SEQUENTIAL FILE  
WHICH IS A DIRECTORY FOR A VARIABLE LENGTH DIRECT ACCESS FILE. THIS FILE        
STRUCTURE IS COMMON TO SEVERAL DDS SYSTEMS EG. SPTDIR/SPTFILE, PRTDIR/PRTFILE,  
REPDIR/REPFILE, MEDIR/MEDFILE.                                                  
         SPACE 1                                                                
THE INDEX SEQUENTIAL FILE (WHICH WILL BE CALLED SYSDIR) HAS RECORDS WHICH       
CONTAIN A KEY, CONTROL BYTES, AND A DISK ADDRESS. THE DISK ADDRESS MUST BE THE  
LAST FOUR BYTES AND MUST POINT TO A RECORD IN THE DIRECT ACCESS FILE (WHICH WILL
BE CALLED SYSFILE). THE DIRECT ACCESS FILE HAS RECORDS WHICH CONTAIN THE KEY,   
RECORD LENGTH, CONTROL BYTES, AND ELEMENTS.                                     
         SPACE 1                                                                
THE INDEX SEQUENTIAL FILE CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE RECORD POINTING TO A RECORD IN 
THE DIRECT ACCESS FILE. THOSE RECORDS IN SYSDIR WHOSE KEY DIFFER FROM THE KEY OF
SYSFILE ARE CALLED PASSIVE POINTERS. PASSIVE POINTERS ARE IGNORED WHEN SYSFILE  
IS COPIED TO TAPE, AND ARE RECREATED IN SYSDIR WHEN SYSFILE IS COPIED BACK TO   
DISK.                                                                           
         SPACE 1                                                                
DMLDMOD CAN ALSO BE USED FOR FILE MAINTENANCE ON A SINGLE INDEX SEQUENTIAL FILE,
IE. WHERE THERE IS NO ASSOCIATED DIRECT ACCESS FILE.                            
         SPACE 1                                                                
THE FILE MAINTENANCE FUNCTIONS ARE DEFINED BY PARAMETER CARDS WHICH SPECIFY THE 
MODE AND OPTIONS. WHEN IN COPY MODE, DMLDMOD CAN BE USED TO COPY A FILE FROM    
DISK TO TAPE (DUMP) OR FROM TAPE TO DISK (LOAD) OR FROM TAPE TO TAPE. WHEN IN   
REPORT MODE, DMLDMOD WILL READ A FILE FROM DISK OR TAPE AND PRODUCE PRINTED     
REPORTS AS SPECIFIED BY THE PARAMETER OPTIONS.                                  
         SPACE 1                                                                
ALL OUTPUT TAPES PRODUCED BY DMLDMOD ARE UNLABELED LOGICAL TAPES. LOGICAL MEANS 
THAT THE TAPE CONTAINS BLOCKED LOGICAL FILE RECORDS. DMLDMOD WILL ACCEPT AS AN  
INPUT TAPE EITHER A LOGICAL TAPE OR A LABELED PHYSICAL TAPE PRODUCED BY THE     
SAVRES SYSTEM. A SAVRES TAPE CAN ONLY BE SPECIFIED FOR A DIRECT ACCESS FILE.    
         SPACE 1                                                                
A LOAD/DUMP PROGRAM IS CREATED FOR A FILE SET BY LINK EDITING DMLDMOD WITH A SET
OF MODULES THAT DEFINE THE FILES AND THE REPORT INFORMATION. IF THE FILES ARE   
SYSDIR AND SYSFILE THE LOAD/DUMP PROGRAM WILL BE CALLED SYSLD. THE EXTERNAL     
MODULES REQUIRED WILL BE DEFINED LATER.

THE PHYSICAL FILE MAINTENACE PROGRAM (PFM) IS A GENERALISED FACILITY USED TO    
DISPLAY RECORDS FOR ANY DDS FILE AND TO HANDLE CHANGES TO THESE RECORDS. THE    
SCREEN IS SHOWN BELOW AND CONSISTS OF INPUT FIELDS TO DEFINE THE FILE,          
RECORD, AND ACTION AND A RECORD DISPLAY AREA OF LENGTH 280 BYTES. THE DISPLAY   
AREA CONSISTS OF 14 LINES EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS 20 BYTES OF RECORD DATA WHICH  
IS DISPLAYED IN HEXADECIMAL AND CHARACTER FORMAT.                               
         SPACE 1                                                                
THE BASIC MODE OF RECORD DISPLAY IS A SEQUENTIAL BYTE DISPLAY OF UPTO 280 BYTES 
BYTES STARTING FROM A NOMINATED INPUT START BYTE. IF A FILE HAS RECORDS         
CONSISTING OF VARIABLE LENGTH ELEMENTS AN ELEMENT CODE OF RECORD DISPLAY IS     
PROVIDED. THE ELEMENT MODE WILL DISPLAY THE FIXED PART OF THE RECORD FOLLOWED   
BY AS MANY ELEMENTS THAT CAN BE FITTED ON THE SCREEN STARTING FROM A NOMINATED  
INPUT ELEMENT.

PFM ALSO CONTAINS A MULTI RECORD DISPLAY FUNCTION WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL    
FILES THAT CAN BE READ SEQUENTIALLY. THE BROWSE FUNCTION WILL DISPLAY WHOLE OR  
PART RECORDS STARTING FROM AN INPUT RECORD ID AND CONTINUING SEQUENTIALLY       
UNTIL THE SCREEN IS FULL.
