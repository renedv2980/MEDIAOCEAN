         TITLE 'LDKEYL - DEMOS - SPECIAL KEY COMPARE TABLE'                     
LDKEYL   CSECT                                                                  
*                                                                               
* THE KEYS INCLUDED IN THIS TABLE ARE ALL PASSIVES. EACH TABLE ENTRY            
* IS TWO BYTES LONG. THE ENTRIES DO NOT NEED TO BE SORTED (A LINEAR             
* SEARCH OF THE TABLE IS PERFORMED BY DELDXMOD WHEN MODE=UPDATE).               
* THE PASSIVES IN THIS TABLE ARE THOSE WHICH ARE *LOGICALLY* DIVIDED            
* INTO TWO COMPONENTS: A UNIQUE KEY, AND A DATA PORTION WHICH MAY               
* CHANGE DURING AN UPDATE.                                                      
*                                                                               
*  BYTE 1: THE FIRST BYTE OF THE KEY (I.E., THE RECORD TYPE).                   
*  BYTE 2: THE LENGTH OF THE MAJOR KEY WHICH IS UNIQUE.                         
*          I.E., IF THE FIRST N BYTES OF THE KEY ARE TRUE KEY FIELDS,           
*                AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE MAJOR KEY CONTAINS            
*                DATA WHICH MAY LEGITIMATELY CHANGE DURING AN UPDATE,           
*                THEN THE VALUE OF BYTE 2 WILL BE N. DELDXMOD WILL              
*                CONSIDER A MATCH ON THE FIRST N BYTES TO BE A MATCH            
*                ON THE COMPLETE KEY, AND WILL UPDATE THE FILE                  
*                ACCORDINGLY (MARKING PASSIVES FOR DELETION IF                  
*                NECESSARY).                                                    
*                                                                               
* THE 'G' KEYS WERE ORIGINALLY HANDLED BY THIS PARTIAL KEY LOGIC,               
* THEN FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS IT WAS HANDLED IN THE CONVERSION. NOW              
* WE'RE TRYING AGAIN TO DO IT THIS WAY. ALL OF THIS NONSENSE IS                 
* BECAUSE NCC CAN'T SEND US AIUE/CARRIAGE FILES THAT ARE HISTORICALLY           
* ACCURATE, SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN THEY REISSUE A FILE.             
* (WE CAN'T JUST LOAD WHAT THEY SEND, BECAUSE WE MIGHT END UP CHANGING          
* AIUE VALUES THAT SHOULDN'T CHANGE.)                                           
* NOTE THAT THE 'G' KEYS ARE ALSO UNUSUAL BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTENDED             
* PASSIVES.
